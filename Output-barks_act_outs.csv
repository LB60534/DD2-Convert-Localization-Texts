Vestal,,affinity_change_attack_same_monster_as_critted,They fear the glare of our torch!
,,affinity_change_attack_same_monster_as_debuffed,They'll be scared of US soon!
,,affinity_change_attack_same_monster_as_debuffed,Well done!
Highwayman,,affinity_change_attack_same_monster_as_debuffed,Now we're fightin' dirty!
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_attack_same_monster_as_debuffed,Now! On the offensive!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_attack_same_monster_as_debuffed,"Hammer on the nail, you are."
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_attack_same_monster_as_debuffed,They are enfeebled! Now!
Occultist,,affinity_change_attack_same_monster_as_debuffed,Now we know what weakens them...
Jester,,affinity_change_attack_same_monster_as_debuffed,Got one over on 'em!!
Leper,,affinity_change_attack_same_monster_as_debuffed,The tide turns.
Hellion,,affinity_change_attack_same_monster_as_debuffed,Never saw you coming!
Runaway,,affinity_change_attack_same_monster_as_debuffed,"Yes! Now, again!"
Vestal,,affinity_change_attack_same_monster_as_debuffed,Banish them!
,,affinity_change_healing_participating,Back in the fray with you!
,,affinity_change_healing_participating,You'll live!
Highwayman,,affinity_change_healing_participating,"What's a little blood, eh."
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_healing_participating,On you go!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_healing_participating,There. Good as gold.
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_healing_participating,Cease your wriggling and let me work!
Occultist,,affinity_change_healing_participating,Allow me.
Jester,,affinity_change_healing_participating,I'll fix that if you stop bleeding on me.
Leper,,affinity_change_healing_participating,This pain of yours - it has a purpose.
Hellion,,affinity_change_healing_participating,You will spill more blood yet!
Runaway,,affinity_change_healing_participating,Lemme get that.
Vestal,,affinity_change_healing_participating,"Close your eyes a moment, friend."
,,affinity_change_healing_participating_dd,Surrender not!
,,affinity_change_healing_participating_dd,Not if I have a say in it!
Highwayman,,affinity_change_healing_participating_dd,Get up. You're tougher than this.
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_healing_participating_dd,On your feet!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_healing_participating_dd,Not while I still need you.
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_healing_participating_dd,I conquered death once - I can do so again!
Occultist,,affinity_change_healing_participating_dd,It is not your time.
Jester,,affinity_change_healing_participating_dd,You can't leave me short-handed.
Leper,,affinity_change_healing_participating_dd,Our journey has not reached its end.
Hellion,,affinity_change_healing_participating_dd,You're no weakling!
Runaway,,affinity_change_healing_participating_dd,No! C'mon! Don't give in!
Vestal,,affinity_change_healing_participating_dd,Trust in the Light and each other.
,,affinity_change_healing_participating_wounded,"You're still in this fight, friend!"
,,affinity_change_healing_participating_wounded,That one looks deep.
Highwayman,,affinity_change_healing_participating_wounded,"Can't leave you hangin', can I?"
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_healing_participating_wounded,What are comrades for?
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_healing_participating_wounded,"T'ain't pretty, but it will hold."
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_healing_participating_wounded,None better for your wounds than I!
Occultist,,affinity_change_healing_participating_wounded,This may hurt.
Jester,,affinity_change_healing_participating_wounded,We'll fix it up proper on the coach later.
Leper,,affinity_change_healing_participating_wounded,You take punishment well.
Hellion,,affinity_change_healing_participating_wounded,We look after one another!
Runaway,,affinity_change_healing_participating_wounded,Can't have you flagging!
Vestal,,affinity_change_healing_participating_wounded,Let me read you a verse...
,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_attacked,You aren't so bad.
,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_attacked,"Much appreciated, friend."
Highwayman,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_attacked,"Well, well."
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_attacked,Seize the opening! There!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_attacked,I do love it when people avenge me.
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_attacked,Skill and coordination!
Occultist,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_attacked,Were you using me as bait? Hah.
Jester,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_attacked,That'll do!
Leper,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_attacked,It is a blessing to fight alone no longer.
Hellion,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_attacked,We will best them as one!
Runaway,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_attacked,"Phew, that'll show 'em."
Vestal,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_attacked,My thanks.
,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_critted,I want that one's head!
,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_critted,Before it can call any allies!
Highwayman,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_critted,Gut the bastards.
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_critted,Show them your mettle!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_critted,Marvelous. Make them bleed!
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_critted,You'd do that for me...?
Occultist,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_critted,Deepest thanks.
Jester,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_critted,I'm touched.
Leper,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_critted,Even a worm will turn - and you are no worm.
Hellion,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_critted,Smell that! The wind turns!
Runaway,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_critted,I wouldn't ask that of you... but thanks.
Vestal,,affinity_change_hit_revenge_critted,Only together do we stand a chance!
,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_pos,Come! This way!
,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_pos,"Pardon, friend."
Highwayman,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_pos,A good ambush is all preparation.
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_pos,"Positions, all! Form up!"
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_pos,"Let me slip past, hm?"
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_pos,I have an idea!
Occultist,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_pos,This position may prove an advantage.
Jester,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_pos,And a one and a two...
Leper,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_pos,I am needed here.
Hellion,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_pos,We can rush them from anywhere!
Runaway,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_pos,Trust me on this!
Vestal,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_pos,I know what I'm doing!
,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating,For your agonies.
,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating,That looks painful.
,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating,Here!
Highwayman,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating,"Pay me back later, eh?"
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating,That ought to do it!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating,You're in fine hands - promise.
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating,I'm sure I have an ampoule for that...
Occultist,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating,Be still! This is my specialty!
Jester,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating,Not your finest moment. Here.
Leper,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating,We prevent suffering where we can.
Hellion,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating,This mud cures maladies! Trust me!
Runaway,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating,I can patch that up!
Vestal,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating,Let the warmth suffuse you...
,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_dd,Return to us!
,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_dd,Clamber back from the precipice!
Highwayman,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_dd,Bite down on somethin'. This might hurt.
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_dd,Stay with us!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_dd,"I'm no physic, but let me try!"
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_dd,Move not an inch! I'm working!
Occultist,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_dd,Thought we'd lost you.
Jester,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_dd,"Cuttin' it close, friend."
Leper,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_dd,Playing dice with fortune herself.
Hellion,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_dd,"Is it not freeing, standing on the edge?!"
Runaway,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_dd,Don't scare us like that.
Vestal,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_dd,Even these wounds can be mended.
,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_wounded,No! I will not allow this!
,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_wounded,"The pain persists, but you'll live!"
Highwayman,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_wounded,That looks nasty. Here.
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_wounded,Mind your wounds!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_wounded,"Here, lest ye grow faint."
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_wounded,We caught this in time. Here!
Occultist,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_wounded,Don't let that run rampant.
Jester,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_wounded,Fine. From my stash.
Leper,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_wounded,Wise not to let this fester.
Hellion,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_wounded,Foul spirits! Miasma in the air!
Runaway,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_wounded,That could spread. Let me.
Vestal,,affinity_change_remove_dot_participating_wounded,You require aid - I provide it.
,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating,There will be time for grief later.
,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating,You cannot afford to dwell on this!
Highwayman,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating,You're a sturdy sort - press on.
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating,None doubt you.
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating,Keep your eyes on the prize.
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating,Verdure and vigour!
Occultist,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating,Your dismay echoes my own - but onward!
Jester,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating,Think on it - you ain't died yet.
Leper,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating,Much beauty remains in this world.
Hellion,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating,I'll drag you through this myself!
Runaway,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating,Shake it off!
Vestal,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating,There is comfort in times of unease.
,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating_stressed,Breathe in. Focus.
,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating_stressed,Steel your mind. The battle is not yet over.
,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating_stressed,All is not lost.
,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating_stressed,We need you!
Highwayman,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating_stressed,One foot in front of the other.
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating_stressed,We leave none behind!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating_stressed,A faintheart you are not.
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating_stressed,We will cure this world.
Occultist,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating_stressed,Move beyond fear. I know you can.
Jester,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating_stressed,Don't count yourself out.
Leper,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating_stressed,Trust in me if you can't trust yourself.
Hellion,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating_stressed,Oust the fear from your heart!
Runaway,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating_stressed,Hold on - just a little longer.
Vestal,,affinity_change_stress_heal_participating_stressed,I see the good in you.
,,affinity_change_add_buff_observing_jealous,You never aid ME!
,,affinity_change_add_buff_observing_jealous,Clearly I've no part in your plan.
Highwayman,,affinity_change_add_buff_observing_jealous,I see how it is.
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_add_buff_observing_jealous,Tactically unwise!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_add_buff_observing_jealous,Hmph! Suit yourself.
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_add_buff_observing_jealous,"By my calculations, you misjudged that."
Occultist,,affinity_change_add_buff_observing_jealous,You may regret that.
Jester,,affinity_change_add_buff_observing_jealous,Am I a joke to you?
Leper,,affinity_change_add_buff_observing_jealous,Swift to aid the others...
Hellion,,affinity_change_add_buff_observing_jealous,Soft-skull!
Runaway,,affinity_change_add_buff_observing_jealous,Nobody listens to me anyway.
Vestal,,affinity_change_add_buff_observing_jealous,"Think yourself so wise, hm?"
,,affinity_change_add_guard_jealous_wounded,I see that I must get by without your help.
,,affinity_change_add_guard_jealous_wounded,You see me suffer and do nothing...!
Highwayman,,affinity_change_add_guard_jealous_wounded,No help over here?
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_add_guard_jealous_wounded,You deploy our strength unwisely!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_add_guard_jealous_wounded,"I will continue bleeding, I suppose."
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_add_guard_jealous_wounded,Inefficient!
Occultist,,affinity_change_add_guard_jealous_wounded,"A fell omen, that."
Jester,,affinity_change_add_guard_jealous_wounded,Did I tick you off somehow?
Leper,,affinity_change_add_guard_jealous_wounded,*quiet grumble*
Hellion,,affinity_change_add_guard_jealous_wounded,I cannot fight if you let me die!
Runaway,,affinity_change_add_guard_jealous_wounded,Good thing I expected no help.
Vestal,,affinity_change_add_guard_jealous_wounded,I surely require it more.
,,affinity_change_add_guard_mortally_jealous,I sit on the brink - and for what?
,,affinity_change_add_guard_mortally_jealous,"If this be the end, you'll regret it."
Highwayman,,affinity_change_add_guard_mortally_jealous,"Mistake it was, counting on you."
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_add_guard_mortally_jealous,"If we lose this day, it's at your feet!"
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_add_guard_mortally_jealous,I deserved better.
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_add_guard_mortally_jealous,"If I bleed out, who will staunch <i>your</i> wounds?"
Occultist,,affinity_change_add_guard_mortally_jealous,So you'd sacrifice me? I see.
Jester,,affinity_change_add_guard_mortally_jealous,"I'll carry on alone, thanks."
Leper,,affinity_change_add_guard_mortally_jealous,You sentence me to death.
Hellion,,affinity_change_add_guard_mortally_jealous,Buffoon!
Runaway,,affinity_change_add_guard_mortally_jealous,What am I worth to you?!
Vestal,,affinity_change_add_guard_mortally_jealous,"If I expire, you shall rue the day."
,,affinity_change_add_token_observing_jealous,Am I of no use...?
,,affinity_change_add_token_observing_jealous,All this talk of teamwork...
,,affinity_change_add_token_observing_jealous,Forgot about me?
,,affinity_change_add_token_observing_jealous,Overlooked once again.
Highwayman,,affinity_change_add_token_observing_jealous,"Trust me so little, do you?"
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_add_token_observing_jealous,You wouldn't know good leadership!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_add_token_observing_jealous,I shall make do without.
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_add_token_observing_jealous,Reckless!
Occultist,,affinity_change_add_token_observing_jealous,You fear my strength.
Jester,,affinity_change_add_token_observing_jealous,We'll see who's laughing when <i>you</i> need help!
Leper,,affinity_change_add_token_observing_jealous,The jackal stalks alone.
Hellion,,affinity_change_add_token_observing_jealous,"Jealous of me, are you?!"
Runaway,,affinity_change_add_token_observing_jealous,Fine! I don't need you!
Vestal,,affinity_change_add_token_observing_jealous,It's as though you wish me weak.
,,affinity_change_feed_jealous,You gorge yourself on food that should be MINE!
,,affinity_change_feed_jealous,Get your paws off <i>my feast!</i>
,,affinity_change_feed_jealous,That banquet is not for you!
,,affinity_change_feed_jealous,"A delectable gift from the Gods, but for ME!"
Highwayman,,affinity_change_feed_jealous,You have no idea how I've starved...
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_feed_jealous,I require that! For my strength!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_feed_jealous,And I thought I was a glutton.
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_feed_jealous,I require nourishment!
Occultist,,affinity_change_feed_jealous,I have hunger beyond your ken.
Jester,,affinity_change_feed_jealous,You don't get to take this from me!
Leper,,affinity_change_feed_jealous,My constitution wanes...
Hellion,,affinity_change_feed_jealous,I'll sever your greedy hands!
Runaway,,affinity_change_feed_jealous,Don't leave me your damned scraps!
Vestal,,affinity_change_feed_jealous,"This feast is a blessing, you selfish lout!"
,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous,And what of <i>my</i> needs?
,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous,Are my wounds not enough?
Highwayman,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous,You think me unworthy?
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous,You never did respect me...
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous,I was wise to never trust you.
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous,You leave your own medic to bleed!
Occultist,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous,"I am slow to anger, but..."
Jester,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous,I mistook you.
Leper,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous,*shakes head*
Hellion,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous,FORSAKEN!
Runaway,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous,That was your last chance!
Vestal,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous,You spurn me in my time of need!
,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous_wounded,Do you not see me bleed?!
,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous_wounded,How dare you!
Highwayman,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous_wounded,Do I look so far gone?
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous_wounded,I am not beyond saving!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous_wounded,"No help coming from you, I see."
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous_wounded,Your eyes must be afflicted!
Occultist,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous_wounded,"A traitor in our midst, perhaps."
Jester,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous_wounded,You'll see no aid from me either.
Leper,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous_wounded,Respect comes hard-earned...
Hellion,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous_wounded,You aid our enemies by ignoring me!
Runaway,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous_wounded,... I thought you were different.
Vestal,,affinity_change_healing_observing_jealous_wounded,After all I've done for you!
,,affinity_change_healing_observing_mortally_jealous,Was I not enough...?
,,affinity_change_healing_observing_mortally_jealous,Abandoned at the end...!
Highwayman,,affinity_change_healing_observing_mortally_jealous,Never trusted you.
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_healing_observing_mortally_jealous,"Leave the old man to die, is it?"
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_healing_observing_mortally_jealous,"I'm not enough, then? So be it."
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_healing_observing_mortally_jealous,A poor distribution of aid!
Occultist,,affinity_change_healing_observing_mortally_jealous,"Toying with our fates, I see."
Jester,,affinity_change_healing_observing_mortally_jealous,"I'll carry on bleeding, then."
Leper,,affinity_change_healing_observing_mortally_jealous,The king on his side upon the board...
Hellion,,affinity_change_healing_observing_mortally_jealous,"ROT, THEN!"
Runaway,,affinity_change_healing_observing_mortally_jealous,My gut was right about you.
Vestal,,affinity_change_healing_observing_mortally_jealous,Who will tend <i>your</i> wounds when I am gone?
,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_neg,Don't jostle me!
,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_neg,Pardon me?
Highwayman,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_neg,I was lining up a shot!
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_neg,You're out of formation!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_neg,You oaf! They'll spy me now!
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_neg,What is the meaning of this?!
Occultist,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_neg,You presume much.
Jester,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_neg,What's the matter - don't trust me?
Leper,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_neg,I know where I am most useful.
Hellion,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_neg,You have not earned the right!
Runaway,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_neg,I don't recall takin' orders from you.
Vestal,,affinity_change_move_displaced_observing_neg,Cease this nervous skittering!
,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous,That ought to have been mine!
,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous,"My trusted ally, indeed..."
Highwayman,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous,"Share the wealth, eh?"
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous,I could have used that!
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous,None for me? Terribly rude.
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous,You think yourself so smart...!
Occultist,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous,Test fate at your own risk.
Jester,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous,"Think I'm useless, do you?"
Leper,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous,I require aid same as any hale soldier.
Hellion,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous,Don't let me grow weak...!
Runaway,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous,I ought to leave you in the dust...
Vestal,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous,By risking me you imperil us all!
,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded,I needed that!
,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded,You're no friend of mine!
Highwayman,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded,Not the first time I've been left bleeding.
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded,A unit is only as strong as its weakest arm...
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded,Left to my own devices again!
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded,You FOOL!
Occultist,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded,I have a long memory...
Jester,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded,"I'll sort myself out, then."
Leper,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded,Hmph.
Hellion,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded,Who shall hold the line then?!
Runaway,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded,Thought you had my back.
Vestal,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_jealous_wounded,You'll rue the day!
,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous,While I breathe my last...?
,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous,"Here I suffer, unaided..."
Highwayman,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous,Fine. Leave me to the fate I deserve...
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous,I see my trust was misplaced.
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous,"P...please, no! You'd leave me to die?!"
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous,You'll be sorry when I'm gone!
Occultist,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous,Unwise.
Jester,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous,So it's come to this.
Leper,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous,"Passing judgment on my health, are you?"
Hellion,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous,You'd sacrifice me?!
Runaway,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous,I trusted you! NO!!
Vestal,,affinity_change_remove_dot_observing_mortally_jealous,"Left me to fend for myself, have you?"
,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,Our burden is heavy - you lighten it.
,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,I never tire of your stories.
,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,Another round?
,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,"I dare say, you lend me hope."
,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,You've got something the others don't.
,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,"The worse it gets, the more we'll need each other."
Highwayman,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,Think I have some dice rattling around in here...
Highwayman,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,C'mere.
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,Pass that here. I'll mend it.
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,Another story? Glad you asked...
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,Share a flask? I'm parched.
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,They broke the mold with you.
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,At last! Someone I can work with!
Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,Think of all we can teach these people!
Occultist,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,You tell such intriguing stories.
Occultist,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,"Pass the snuff box, would you?"
Jester,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,Heh heh. Good one.
Jester,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,Tell you 'bout my travels? Suppose I can.
Leper,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,"My story? I suppose, for you..."
Leper,,affinity_change_banter_positive_low_stress,You are a rock in troublesome times.

Hellion,,affinity_change_banter_negative_low_stress,"Like a horse-fly, you are!"
Hellion,,affinity_change_banter_negative_low_stress,I was saving that for later!
Runaway,,affinity_change_banter_negative_low_stress,Can't say I trust you yet.
Runaway,,affinity_change_banter_negative_low_stress,Why you want to know so much about me?
Vestal,,affinity_change_banter_negative_low_stress,I find your hygiene troubling.
Vestal,,affinity_change_banter_negative_low_stress,"You may sit beside me, but be <i>quiet.</i>"

Highwayman,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,You'll double-cross me. I'm sure.
Highwayman,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,Accuse me of cheatin' one more time...
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,Fate has sent you here to torment me.
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,I might be old but I'll still tan yer hide.
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,You remind me of someone I once loathed.
Grave Robber,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,Take your trifling matters elsewhere.

Plague Doctor,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,You bicker as a child does!
Occultist,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,"I am a patient man, but I have my limits."

Leper,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,Allow a tired man his rest.
Hellion,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,Those who sit beside me must EARN it.
Hellion,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,You've a coward's stink on you!
Runaway,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,I was better off alone.
Runaway,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,I regret ever opening up to you.
Vestal,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,Mistake me not for a friend.
Vestal,,affinity_change_banter_negative_med_stress,Babble at someone else. I'm resting.

,,affinity_change_banter_negative_high_stress,"If I gut you now, more food for me."
,,affinity_change_banter_negative_high_stress,"If you're the best we've got, 'tis hopeless."
Highwayman,,affinity_change_banter_negative_high_stress,Get your boot off my bunk if you value that foot.
Highwayman,,affinity_change_banter_negative_high_stress,What's <i>wrong?</i> Look outside. You daft?
Man-at-arms,,affinity_change_banter_negative_high_stress,Has a man not earned some peace?

,,arena_modifier_start_coast_boss_fog,I've lost sight of them!
,,arena_modifier_start_coast_boss_fog,"What trickery, this mist?"
,,arena_modifier_start_coast_boss_fog,"Illusion and deceit, this weather!"

,,arena_modifier_stop_coast_fog,The air clears...
,,arena_modifier_stop_coast_fog,"At long last, a breeze!"

,,item_armor_repair_kit,Time to pound out some dents.
Occultist,,item_armor_repair_kit,Any weakness must be sought out to avoid death.
Man-at-arms,,item_armor_repair_kit,A soldier's most essential duty.
Plague Doctor,,item_armor_repair_kit,Hmm. Perhaps I could improve its efficacy.
Grave Robber,,item_armor_repair_kit,Not my most favoured activity.
Highwayman,,item_armor_repair_kit,"This kind of work is never finished, is it?"
Jester,,item_armor_repair_kit,There <i>is</i> a breastplate under this.
Bounty Hunter,,item_armor_repair_kit,Don't skimp on the kit.
Hellion,,item_armor_repair_kit,Spit and polish - good as new.
Runaway,,item_armor_repair_kit,"My kit's mostly scraps, but we'll see..."
Leper,,item_armor_repair_kit,It is good luck to leave a small chink.
,,item_blasphemous_idol,What harm is there in a small prayer and a bit of blood?
Occultist,,item_blasphemous_idol,I will try to extract favours from this imp.
Man-at-arms,,item_blasphemous_idol,I once fought a jungle campaign where soldiers bent our luck with these.
Plague Doctor,,item_blasphemous_idol,Perhaps what they say is true...
Grave Robber,,item_blasphemous_idol,I've prayed to worse!
Highwayman,,item_blasphemous_idol,I can't discount any advantage.
Jester,,item_blasphemous_idol,I am desperate for inspiration.
Bounty Hunter,,item_blasphemous_idol,Hmm.
Hellion,,item_blasphemous_idol,The clans know the wisdom of the old Gods.
Runaway,,item_blasphemous_idol,Can't be picky with your luck on the road.
Leper,,item_blasphemous_idol,I prayed to anything when I was desperate to live.
,,item_book_bawdy_tales,I'll be inside. Don't bother me.
Occultist,,item_book_bawdy_tales,All tomes are worthy of study.
Man-at-arms,,item_book_bawdy_tales,Well... Uhm... I am merely curious.
Plague Doctor,,item_book_bawdy_tales,I require this for an... experiment.
Grave Robber,,item_book_bawdy_tales,Reminds me of old correspondence...
Highwayman,,item_book_bawdy_tales,We all get bored.
Jester,,item_book_bawdy_tales,"Finally, one I haven't read yet."
Bounty Hunter,,item_book_bawdy_tales,"Don't ask, don't tell."
Hellion,,item_book_bawdy_tales,"Read it to me? ... Eugh, or maybe not."
Runaway,,item_book_bawdy_tales,I'll be in my bunk.
Leper,,item_book_bawdy_tales,Simple fare but always titillating.
,,item_book_desert,Seems a fascinating tale of solitude.
Occultist,,item_book_desert,A nostalgic read for myself.
Man-at-arms,,item_book_desert,Unfamiliar terrain for me! Interesting...
Plague Doctor,,item_book_desert,I have much to learn about the drier climes!
Grave Robber,,item_book_desert,He always promised to take me somewhere sunny...
Highwayman,,item_book_desert,"Sand for miles, what a strange land."
Jester,,item_book_desert,Endless wastes. Could distract me from these endless wastes.
Bounty Hunter,,item_book_desert,Tactical research.
Hellion,,item_book_desert,Wonder what they hunt out there.
Runaway,,item_book_desert,... Lotta places I haven't been to yet.
Leper,,item_book_desert,"The dunes, the countless stars... old friends from my childhood."
,,item_book_insults,To enrage is to make vulnerable!
Occultist,,item_book_insults,Means to unbalance the enemy's mind.
Man-at-arms,,item_book_insults,"Sharp sword, sharper wit."
Plague Doctor,,item_book_insults,To enrage a foe is to reduce its efficiency.
Grave Robber,,item_book_insults,"Hmm. I know the author, actually."
Highwayman,,item_book_insults,Worth a try in a fight.
Jester,,item_book_insults,It's a little insulting I have to read this.
Bounty Hunter,,item_book_insults,Heh heh.
Hellion,,item_book_insults,Townfolk bickering goes right over my head.
Runaway,,item_book_insults,"Wait, is THAT how you pronounce it...?"
Leper,,item_book_insults,A childish weapon for immature minds.
,,item_book_parries,If I'm to bleed then so should my foe!
Occultist,,item_book_parries,"I prefer the proven defense of range, but..."
Man-at-arms,,item_book_parries,Who's up for drills? On your feet!
Plague Doctor,,item_book_parries,Bladework is a precise science!
Grave Robber,,item_book_parries,These are always written for men.
Highwayman,,item_book_parries,Might learn something new.
Jester,,item_book_parries,Didn't even know I could parry with a sickle.
Bounty Hunter,,item_book_parries,"Not my style, but why not?"
Hellion,,item_book_parries,"Hmph. If you have to parry, your first strike was weak."
Runaway,,item_book_parries,Oof. Can I practice with you?
Leper,,item_book_parries,I am not so far gone that I cannot learn.
,,item_book_poetry,What exquisite stanzas!
Occultist,,item_book_poetry,All spells are basically poems of a sort.
Man-at-arms,,item_book_poetry,I may have already read this one.
Plague Doctor,,item_book_poetry,I usually only read scientific texts.
Grave Robber,,item_book_poetry,I had libraries of this stuff once.
Highwayman,,item_book_poetry,Reminds me of a lover I once had.
Jester,,item_book_poetry,"I only borrow, never steal."
Bounty Hunter,,item_book_poetry,<i>Nothing</i> else to read?
Hellion,,item_book_poetry,What are these? War songs without drums?
Runaway,,item_book_poetry,"A lot of pretty words, but it's not <i>about</i> anything."
Leper,,item_book_poetry,I think this one was written in my court.
,,item_boxing_gloves,"Nothing below the belt, please."
Occultist,,item_boxing_gloves,"Strike my turban, if you dare."
Man-at-arms,,item_boxing_gloves,Shall I tie a hand behind my back?
Plague Doctor,,item_boxing_gloves,Practicing pugilism prepares properly!
Grave Robber,,item_boxing_gloves,A little tussle to work out the kinks!
Highwayman,,item_boxing_gloves,First to fall?
Jester,,item_boxing_gloves,"Hum a li'l lullaby, sing like a banshee!"
Bounty Hunter,,item_boxing_gloves,I won't go easy.
Hellion,,item_boxing_gloves,I only pull my punches for friends.
Runaway,,item_boxing_gloves,Hah! Put 'em up! Better be quick!
Leper,,item_boxing_gloves,I trust you'd prefer I keep the mask on.
,,item_calming_incense,Inhale deeply and clear your mind.
Occultist,,item_calming_incense,Tension melts away. The prowling mind stills.
Man-at-arms,,item_calming_incense,I'm more knot than muscle - pass it here.
Plague Doctor,,item_calming_incense,"Strange, the effect vapours can have on anatomy."
Grave Robber,,item_calming_incense,Smells cheap... but one can't be precious on the road.
Highwayman,,item_calming_incense,"You callin' me tense? ... Fine, fine."
Jester,,item_calming_incense,Had a patron named Neroli once. *sniff*
Bounty Hunter,,item_calming_incense,Smells all right.
Hellion,,item_calming_incense,*sniff* My eyes feel heavy already...
Runaway,,item_calming_incense,This smoke doesn't smell like smoke. Strange.
Leper,,item_calming_incense,A sweet scent evoking bittersweet memories...
,,item_candles_and_chocolate,Let's go around back.
Occultist,,item_candles_and_chocolate,Let us intertwine auras.
Man-at-arms,,item_candles_and_chocolate,"War has made me coarse, let these offerings soften my chances."
Plague Doctor,,item_candles_and_chocolate,Now I shall study the carnal disciplines.
Grave Robber,,item_candles_and_chocolate,"Let's give this a proper go, eh?"
Highwayman,,item_candles_and_chocolate,"Love, my greatest foe."
Jester,,item_candles_and_chocolate,Usually I only need my lute...
Bounty Hunter,,item_candles_and_chocolate,*snort*
Hellion,,item_candles_and_chocolate,Lot of fuss for a tussle in the furs.
Runaway,,item_candles_and_chocolate,Let's see if my hammock can hold two.
Leper,,item_candles_and_chocolate,I hope the candles are scented.
,,item_clarifying_poultice,A little on the temples to clear the mind.
Occultist,,item_clarifying_poultice,I must manifest my psyche unto the flesh.
Man-at-arms,,item_clarifying_poultice,Keeps me on my feet when a cudgel rings the ol' bell!
Plague Doctor,,item_clarifying_poultice,Helps stabilize the humours!
Grave Robber,,item_clarifying_poultice,Lose your focus and you'll lose your life.
Highwayman,,item_clarifying_poultice,For when a tree branch slams against your favourite skull.
Jester,,item_clarifying_poultice,Take a big smack and this will keep you on beat.
Bounty Hunter,,item_clarifying_poultice,*sharp sniff*
Hellion,,item_clarifying_poultice,Hoo! That rouses the senses!
Runaway,,item_clarifying_poultice,Good for long nights on watch.
Leper,,item_clarifying_poultice,I coat the inside of my mask with this.
,,item_clotting_poultice,May my wounds close swiftly!
Occultist,,item_clotting_poultice,Blood stains more than the ground.
Man-at-arms,,item_clotting_poultice,Slather this on vital arteries!
Plague Doctor,,item_clotting_poultice,To arrest unnecessary exsanguination!
Grave Robber,,item_clotting_poultice,The less bleeding the better.
Highwayman,,item_clotting_poultice,No one likes to bleed.
Jester,,item_clotting_poultice,Can't get blood on the strings.
Bounty Hunter,,item_clotting_poultice,Better than bleeding.
Hellion,,item_clotting_poultice,Blood is life! Ours and our kin!
Runaway,,item_clotting_poultice,Give it here. So I don't slow us down.
Leper,,item_clotting_poultice,Every drop counts.
,,item_dart_board,Put the board up away from the windows this time.
Occultist,,item_dart_board,Is it skill or is it fate?
Man-at-arms,,item_dart_board,"Though my fingers be clumsy, I do enjoy this."
Plague Doctor,,item_dart_board,Juvenile pastimes do lighten the mood so!
Grave Robber,,item_dart_board,Who wants a shot at the champ?
Highwayman,,item_dart_board,Five relics for each bullseye.
Jester,,item_dart_board,I'll try not to cheat.
Bounty Hunter,,item_dart_board,Good practice.
Hellion,,item_dart_board,Hmph. These things are so brittle!
Runaway,,item_dart_board,Hah! You wanna wager chores?
Leper,,item_dart_board,This mask obscures my vision so.
,,item_drum,Dancing draws much from fighting.
Occultist,,item_drum,There are rhythms that lie outside of time.
Man-at-arms,,item_drum,Drums guide formations and maintain the line!
Plague Doctor,,item_drum,"Practicing mobility to stand firm, how curious."
Grave Robber,,item_drum,Practiced feet will not betray you.
Highwayman,,item_drum,"Boring exercise, but useful."
Jester,,item_drum,Pa-rum-pa-pum-pumm!
Bounty Hunter,,item_drum,I don't get it.
Hellion,,item_drum,Circle the drums! Beat hard! Beat fast! KALIIIII-YAH!
Runaway,,item_drum,Just so long as we don't spook the horses.
Leper,,item_drum,A small ditty to keep the feet firm.
,,item_food_1,"Cold, slimy, and fills the gullet."
Occultist,,item_food_1,Similar to the Xiccarphian fungoids I once hunted...
Man-at-arms,,item_food_1,Hah! Can't be choosy in the field.
Plague Doctor,,item_food_1,Efficacious but troubling nonetheless.
Grave Robber,,item_food_1,Uuugh. How far I have fallen...
Highwayman,,item_food_1,I've had worse.
Jester,,item_food_1,Sure this wasn't growing on the real food?
Bounty Hunter,,item_food_1,Hmph. Little bland.
Hellion,,item_food_1,It's food. You won't hear me complain.
Runaway,,item_food_1,Ech. If you heat it up it's even worse.
Leper,,item_food_1,Nature provides for us in its own strange way.
,,item_food_1_use_limit,Had quite enough of that.
Occultist,,item_food_1_use_limit,My hunger is sated.
Man-at-arms,,item_food_1_use_limit,"Full up on this crud, thank ye."
Plague Doctor,,item_food_1_use_limit,I've no need for another sample.
Grave Robber,,item_food_1_use_limit,I am not yet so desperate.
Highwayman,,item_food_1_use_limit,Had enough.
Jester,,item_food_1_use_limit,Had my fill of that slimy stuff.
Bounty Hunter,,item_food_1_use_limit,Nah.
Hellion,,item_food_1_use_limit,I want for nothing.
Runaway,,item_food_1_use_limit,Best save it 'til it's needed.
Leper,,item_food_1_use_limit,My body has no demands for now.
,,item_food_2,Need something to wash this down.
Occultist,,item_food_2,Even this will bring power.
Man-at-arms,,item_food_2,We had worse on the front.
Plague Doctor,,item_food_2,Somewhat desiccated but no sign of fungal growth.
Grave Robber,,item_food_2,Surely we have spreads somewhere. Jam...? Honey...?
Highwayman,,item_food_2,Can't be too picky on the road.
Jester,,item_food_2,Which will grow older - this old bread or us?
Bounty Hunter,,item_food_2,*crunch*
Hellion,,item_food_2,"Ah, well. It soaks up the wine."
Runaway,,item_food_2,It's food. It's free. No complaints from me.
Leper,,item_food_2,Difficult to swallow unless I soak it first...
,,item_food_2_use_limit,Surprisingly filling.
Occultist,,item_food_2_use_limit,I have had my fair share.
Man-at-arms,,item_food_2_use_limit,Too much bread. Need some shut-eye.
Plague Doctor,,item_food_2_use_limit,That bland bread is rather filling.
Grave Robber,,item_food_2_use_limit,I couldn't stomach another dreary bite.
Highwayman,,item_food_2_use_limit,Save the rest for the road.
Jester,,item_food_2_use_limit,"I know I appear starved, but no."
Bounty Hunter,,item_food_2_use_limit,Pass.
Hellion,,item_food_2_use_limit,I take smaller meals on the hunt.
Runaway,,item_food_2_use_limit,Nah.
Leper,,item_food_2_use_limit,I require nothing further.
,,item_food_3,"Don't recognize this particular cheese, tasty though."
Occultist,,item_food_3,Sensorially adequate.
Man-at-arms,,item_food_3,"Ah, I <i>was</i> feelin' a bit peckish. *crunch*"
Plague Doctor,,item_food_3,That crisp crunch! It's been a long time...
Grave Robber,,item_food_3,Add some cured venison and we're in business.
Highwayman,,item_food_3,"Mm, hits the spot."
Jester,,item_food_3,A satisfying snack... got more?
Bounty Hunter,,item_food_3,Filling. Decent. Seconds?
Hellion,,item_food_3,Cheese was a luxury in our camp. Mmm!
Runaway,,item_food_3,And I didn't even have to steal it.
Leper,,item_food_3,Simple but satisfying - perfect for long journeys.
,,item_food_3_use_limit,"Tasty, but I've had enough."
Occultist,,item_food_3_use_limit,I am content at present.
Man-at-arms,,item_food_3_use_limit,Can't overdo it on that rich stuff.
Plague Doctor,,item_food_3_use_limit,"A fine treat, but I am sated."
Grave Robber,,item_food_3_use_limit,"Saving room for a tipple, no thank ye."
Highwayman,,item_food_3_use_limit,I'm well'n good for now.
Jester,,item_food_3_use_limit,A full belly! Luxurious.
Bounty Hunter,,item_food_3_use_limit,Full up for now.
Hellion,,item_food_3_use_limit,*satisfied belch*
Runaway,,item_food_3_use_limit,I even ate the cores. ... What!
Leper,,item_food_3_use_limit,Pity I haven't room for more.
,,item_food_4,A bit overdone but hits the spot.
Occultist,,item_food_4,"A cantrip to soften the gristle, then."
Man-at-arms,,item_food_4,Now that'll do me. Pass the gravy!
Plague Doctor,,item_food_4,Fat and protein to stimulate the appetite.
Grave Robber,,item_food_4,A reasonable impression of decent fare.
Highwayman,,item_food_4,Now this is the stuff!
Jester,,item_food_4,I prefer mine a little bloodier... heheh.
Bounty Hunter,,item_food_4,Tasty and a lot of it - perfect combination.
Hellion,,item_food_4,Let me sear the next lot!
Runaway,,item_food_4,I'll swap you my steak for more potatoes?
Leper,,item_food_4,A hearty meal after a long day's labour.
,,item_food_4_use_limit,Ahhh. *burp*
Occultist,,item_food_4_use_limit,One of the better meals I've had whilst traveling.
Man-at-arms,,item_food_4_use_limit,Pray my belt still fits...
Plague Doctor,,item_food_4_use_limit,My last meal was fuel enough.
Grave Robber,,item_food_4_use_limit,"Nay, not one spud more."
Highwayman,,item_food_4_use_limit,I'm stuffed.
Jester,,item_food_4_use_limit,Would that I could...
Bounty Hunter,,item_food_4_use_limit,A satisfying feed.
Hellion,,item_food_4_use_limit,I'll sleep heavy tonight.
Runaway,,item_food_4_use_limit,I stomached what I could. That smell...
Leper,,item_food_4_use_limit,Hunger troubles me no longer.
,,item_food_5,Made this on the Stagecoach stove?
Occultist,,item_food_5,Humble but filling.
Man-at-arms,,item_food_5,"Reminds me of the officer's mess, not bad!"
Plague Doctor,,item_food_5,Baking is akin to alchemy. You're a promising student.
Grave Robber,,item_food_5,"Simple, yes, but... pleasing texture."
Highwayman,,item_food_5,I'll take a half dozen.
Jester,,item_food_5,Shall we sell these by the roadside next?
Bounty Hunter,,item_food_5,Smells good in here.
Hellion,,item_food_5,A band of hunters bonding 'round the cookfire...
Runaway,,item_food_5,We can cook without stopping? Perfect.
Leper,,item_food_5,"Warm, simple - good for days when the stomach ails."
,,item_food_5_use_limit,"Simple, warm, satisfying."
Occultist,,item_food_5_use_limit,Now I shall sleep off some bruises.
Man-at-arms,,item_food_5_use_limit,Another flapjack might end my campaign.
Plague Doctor,,item_food_5_use_limit,"I couldn't, not one more bite!"
Grave Robber,,item_food_5_use_limit,I'll direct my gluttony toward other vices for now.
Highwayman,,item_food_5_use_limit,Hardly ever turn down a meal - but no.
Jester,,item_food_5_use_limit,Fed and fit for whatever awaits.
Bounty Hunter,,item_food_5_use_limit,They'll keep for the road ahead.
Hellion,,item_food_5_use_limit,My belly is full.
Runaway,,item_food_5_use_limit,Leave me be. I'm full.
Leper,,item_food_5_use_limit,I need not overindulge. I am content.

Plague Doctor,,item_holy_beads,A true scientist harnesses all energies.
Grave Robber,,item_holy_beads,This worked for an old partner... until it didn't.
Highwayman,,item_holy_beads,I felt a strange pull...
Jester,,item_holy_beads,I am really desperate for inspiration.
Bounty Hunter,,item_holy_beads,It comes to this.
Hellion,,item_holy_beads,My ancestors never needed these... but why not.
Runaway,,item_holy_beads,*gulp* ... No! I'll try 'em! I'm not scared!
Leper,,item_holy_beads,My first fruitless hope was seeded with these beads.
,,item_impermeable_poultice,A bane against pestilence!
Occultist,,item_impermeable_poultice,Any blight should be prevented.
Man-at-arms,,item_impermeable_poultice,We will likely face cowards who employ venom!
Plague Doctor,,item_impermeable_poultice,Not as potent as my formula but should draw out impurities.
Grave Robber,,item_impermeable_poultice,Effective even against my own venom.
Highwayman,,item_impermeable_poultice,Good against all kinds of nasty.
Jester,,item_impermeable_poultice,Fungus and poison are hard to rhyme to.
Bounty Hunter,,item_impermeable_poultice,Can't afford falling ill.
Hellion,,item_impermeable_poultice,Smells foul so it must work.

Man-at-arms,,item_meditative_totem,"Any advantage in the field, I suppose..."
Plague Doctor,,item_meditative_totem,Occupies the hands while the mind contemplates.
Grave Robber,,item_meditative_totem,"Cheap materials, yet it's somehow artful."
Highwayman,,item_meditative_totem,"Never been a superstitious type, but..."
Jester,,item_meditative_totem,What a weird little trinket! Who made you?
Bounty Hunter,,item_meditative_totem,"Not sure these work, but..."
Hellion,,item_meditative_totem,"Spirits of old, my blood who came before me..."
Runaway,,item_meditative_totem,I make my own luck.
Leper,,item_meditative_totem,A stone skips across calm waters. Ripples follow.
,,item_mop,Menial but necessary.
Occultist,,item_mop,Cleanliness repels many sordid beings.
Man-at-arms,,item_mop,A general with a mop inspires forthright effort.
Plague Doctor,,item_mop,A clean laboratory produces consistent results.
Grave Robber,,item_mop,Is this how you hold it?
Highwayman,,item_mop,Labour is a release from past sins.
Jester,,item_mop,The soft swish is most relaxing.
Bounty Hunter,,item_mop,You're paying me a <i>lot</i> for this.
Hellion,,item_mop,"If they can't smell the blood, they can't track us."

Plague Doctor,,item_nightshade_concoction,I need to study this strange plant further.
Grave Robber,,item_nightshade_concoction,A foul-tasting way to cheat Death.
Highwayman,,item_nightshade_concoction,Bitter but worth it.
Jester,,item_nightshade_concoction,It's said to repel Death herself.
Bounty Hunter,,item_nightshade_concoction,An old trade secret...
Hellion,,item_nightshade_concoction,Chase it with wine if you must. Feh.
Runaway,,item_nightshade_concoction,"If I can't outrun Death, I'll cheat."
Leper,,item_nightshade_concoction,Better to temper Death's temptation.
,,item_pipeweed,I'll show you how to blow rings.
Occultist,,item_pipeweed,Dimensions bloom with each puff.
Man-at-arms,,item_pipeweed,I used to confiscate plugs of this from my soldiers.

Highwayman,,item_pipeweed,A steadfast companion for the long road.
Jester,,item_pipeweed,"Ah, sweet muse!"

Occultist,,item_playing_cards,Have I ever explained the symbols on these cards?
Man-at-arms,,item_playing_cards,Never let soldiers play for money.
Plague Doctor,,item_playing_cards,A simple mathematical challenge.
Grave Robber,,item_playing_cards,"I won't cheat this time, honest!"
Highwayman,,item_playing_cards,I'll shuffle.
Jester,,item_playing_cards,Was this your card?
Bounty Hunter,,item_playing_cards,Ante up.
Hellion,,item_playing_cards,But what do I get if I <i>win?</i>
Runaway,,item_playing_cards,"No sneaky fingers, dealer! I'm watching!"
Leper,,item_playing_cards,A pleasant diversion or a tool of divination.
,,item_restorative_herbs,It does soothe the pain some.
Occultist,,item_restorative_herbs,Material solutions for the corporeal shell.
Man-at-arms,,item_restorative_herbs,A battlefield medic's staple!
Plague Doctor,,item_restorative_herbs,Unproven but seemingly effective.
Grave Robber,,item_restorative_herbs,Gah! What a stench!
Highwayman,,item_restorative_herbs,"If it works, it works."
Jester,,item_restorative_herbs,It also clears the phlegm from my throat.
Bounty Hunter,,item_restorative_herbs,"Feh, that stench."
Hellion,,item_restorative_herbs,Stinks... but wound rot stinks worse.
Runaway,,item_restorative_herbs,Yee-uck!
Leper,,item_restorative_herbs,What remains of my nose is displeased.
,,item_roast_pig,"Pleasant company and a full stomach, huzzah!"
Occultist,,item_roast_pig,Pork is delightful in all dimensions.
Man-at-arms,,item_roast_pig,Fabulous! Fabulous!
Plague Doctor,,item_roast_pig,It smells exactly like burning human flesh!
Grave Robber,,item_roast_pig,Coarse fare but satisfying.
Highwayman,,item_roast_pig,A rare delight.
Jester,,item_roast_pig,I'll sing for this meal!
Bounty Hunter,,item_roast_pig,Ribs. Now.
Hellion,,item_roast_pig,A hearty meal for a long journey. Eat up!
Runaway,,item_roast_pig,I haven't eaten this good in... maybe ever.
Leper,,item_roast_pig,Once a staple in my court long ago. Just missing the apple.
,,item_roast_pig_use_limit,A plentiful feast - I've had my fill.
Occultist,,item_roast_pig_use_limit,"I need no further nourishment, pleasant as that smells."
Man-at-arms,,item_roast_pig_use_limit,"One more bite? ... Alas, no room."
Plague Doctor,,item_roast_pig_use_limit,I feel strangely content - best not push it.
Grave Robber,,item_roast_pig_use_limit,Warm hearth. Full stomach. I require no more.
Highwayman,,item_roast_pig_use_limit,"Tempting, but no."
Jester,,item_roast_pig_use_limit,My stomach rumbles no more!
Bounty Hunter,,item_roast_pig_use_limit,*contented burp*
Hellion,,item_roast_pig_use_limit,Woe that I am too full!
Runaway,,item_roast_pig_use_limit,Not hungry yet. More's the pity.
Leper,,item_roast_pig_use_limit,Share my portion between the others instead.
,,item_songbook_amorous,To all the loves I've had and lost.
Occultist,,item_songbook_amorous,"Would be more of a trio, technically speaking."
Man-at-arms,,item_songbook_amorous,"Let this old dog show you a few tricks, eh?"
Plague Doctor,,item_songbook_amorous,Heated reagants... undocumented results... so far.
Grave Robber,,item_songbook_amorous,Been a while since someone tried <i>this</i> on me...
Highwayman,,item_songbook_amorous,Love spurned me once. But I can forget for a night.
Jester,,item_songbook_amorous,Careful - might write a new one for you.
Bounty Hunter,,item_songbook_amorous,Mask off this time.
Hellion,,item_songbook_amorous,"A song for the fireside, eh? Come closer."
Runaway,,item_songbook_amorous,We're here. We're breathing. Isn't that enough?
Leper,,item_songbook_amorous,The heart beats persistent despite its failing shell.
,,item_songbook_morose,I must give voice to my grief.
Occultist,,item_songbook_morose,Mourning hymns old as time and the gods.
Man-at-arms,,item_songbook_morose,"You deserved more than a song, brothers..."
Plague Doctor,,item_songbook_morose,A body is merely inert tissue. But if mourning helps...
Grave Robber,,item_songbook_morose,"If I can carry one tune, it's a dirge, love."
Highwayman,,item_songbook_morose,"*slow, haunting whistling*"
Jester,,item_songbook_morose,"*gentle, melancholy strumming*"
Bounty Hunter,,item_songbook_morose,Seems awful sentimental.
Hellion,,item_songbook_morose,We sing for the kin we've laid to rest.
Runaway,,item_songbook_morose,Sounds like church songs. Pretty but sad.
Leper,,item_songbook_morose,A song for the years I'll never see.
,,item_songbook_rousing,Tell me if I'm in tune!
Occultist,,item_songbook_rousing,My blood stirs! Let us have at them!
Man-at-arms,,item_songbook_rousing,No book needed - I know this lot by heart!
Plague Doctor,,item_songbook_rousing,One to rile the humours!
Grave Robber,,item_songbook_rousing,Up lasses! Up lads! We ride!
Highwayman,,item_songbook_rousing,We sang these on the chain gang...
Jester,,item_songbook_rousing,*fierce strumming* I can hardly keep up!
Bounty Hunter,,item_songbook_rousing,I don't sing. But I'll listen.
Hellion,,item_songbook_rousing,KIII-YAH! Shed your skins and howl!
Runaway,,item_songbook_rousing,We roar like flames! Let 'em hear us!
Leper,,item_songbook_rousing,A roaring army thundering over the plains...
,,item_soothing_poultice,This should tame the burning.
Occultist,,item_soothing_poultice,I have no desire to burn.
Man-at-arms,,item_soothing_poultice,I favoured this when facing greek fire!
Plague Doctor,,item_soothing_poultice,Useful to keep flesh from combusting.
Grave Robber,,item_soothing_poultice,This also does wonders for crow's feet.
Highwayman,,item_soothing_poultice,Fire can make for a nasty foe.
Jester,,item_soothing_poultice,This is for the lute.
Bounty Hunter,,item_soothing_poultice,I hate fire.
Hellion,,item_soothing_poultice,"Ahh, cool as fresh mud."
Runaway,,item_soothing_poultice,Soothe the burn? Why would I want to...?
Leper,,item_soothing_poultice,"Not much left to burn, really."
,,item_speed_bag,My timing needs honing.
Occultist,,item_speed_bag,This physical shell needs enhancement.
Man-at-arms,,item_speed_bag,Reflexes are the first and best line of defense!
Plague Doctor,,item_speed_bag,A mindless pastime can be relaxing.
Grave Robber,,item_speed_bag,I just fix the image of my former husband in my mind...
Highwayman,,item_speed_bag,Where are the wraps?
Jester,,item_speed_bag,Rhythm at speed demands precision!
Bounty Hunter,,item_speed_bag,*cracks knuckles*
Hellion,,item_speed_bag,"Train with me, eh? Best keep up!"
Runaway,,item_speed_bag,A round with this and maybe a spar after!
Leper,,item_speed_bag,"I'm already wrapped, thanks."
,,item_stew,Plain but fortifying.
Occultist,,item_stew,An unfamiliar aroma but it is filling.
Man-at-arms,,item_stew,My stomach grumbles in trepidation!
Plague Doctor,,item_stew,A bowl would nourish my body.
Grave Robber,,item_stew,You call this food?
Highwayman,,item_stew,The finest meal is the meal you're eating.
Jester,,item_stew,And here I was going to let my stomach do the singing.
Bounty Hunter,,item_stew,Not bad.
Hellion,,item_stew,A good use for old game.
Runaway,,item_stew,Never turn down a hot meal.
Leper,,item_stew,Every meal a feast.
,,item_stew_use_limit,That'll be all.
Occultist,,item_stew_use_limit,Leave me to my contemplations.
Man-at-arms,,item_stew_use_limit,I've 'ad enough.
Plague Doctor,,item_stew_use_limit,My appetite wanes of late. Pass.
Grave Robber,,item_stew_use_limit,One bowl of that sludge was plenty.
Highwayman,,item_stew_use_limit,I've had me fill. Leave me be.
Jester,,item_stew_use_limit,A second bowl? Where would I put it?
Bounty Hunter,,item_stew_use_limit,Save it.
Hellion,,item_stew_use_limit,Leave the broth to thicken overnight.
Runaway,,item_stew_use_limit,Already had seconds when y'weren't looking.
Leper,,item_stew_use_limit,One of the others may need it more.
,,item_stimulating_poultice,Is my hand shaking?
Occultist,,item_stimulating_poultice,Herbs to augment rapidity.
Man-at-arms,,item_stimulating_poultice,Anything to quicken the weapon hand.
Plague Doctor,,item_stimulating_poultice,This accelerates the blood!
Grave Robber,,item_stimulating_poultice,Speed keeps me alive.
Highwayman,,item_stimulating_poultice,"The quicker the slash, the shorter the fight."
Jester,,item_stimulating_poultice,Why settle for 1/16th when there's 1/32nd?
Bounty Hunter,,item_stimulating_poultice,Better to hit them first.
Hellion,,item_stimulating_poultice,I can feel the blood-rush coming on!
Runaway,,item_stimulating_poultice,Anything to stay a step ahead.
Leper,,item_stimulating_poultice,This makes my hand quake after battle.
,,item_stitching_kit,Please get it over with.
Occultist,,item_stitching_kit,Is this another kind of blood ritual?
Man-at-arms,,item_stitching_kit,Draw my dissenting flesh together!
Plague Doctor,,item_stitching_kit,I can do this myself.
Grave Robber,,item_stitching_kit,Better to not get cut in the first place.
Highwayman,,item_stitching_kit,You'd think I'd be better at this by now.
Jester,,item_stitching_kit,My skin is basically patchwork now.
Bounty Hunter,,item_stitching_kit,Serves me right.
Hellion,,item_stitching_kit,What's one more scar!
Runaway,,item_stitching_kit,You better keep that hand steady...
Leper,,item_stitching_kit,For what little remains.
,,item_the_wine,Sip and savor. There is no vintage like it.
Occultist,,item_the_wine,"Come, come, I prefer not to imbibe alone."
Man-at-arms,,item_the_wine,How's about we split this?
Plague Doctor,,item_the_wine,Hmph. Well. Fine. Burns less than the other stuff.
Grave Robber,,item_the_wine,"Share a nightcap, love?"
Highwayman,,item_the_wine,"I'm not often the sharing sort, but what do you say?"
Jester,,item_the_wine,"A rare treat, pilfered from some louche estate."
Bounty Hunter,,item_the_wine,*slurp* Awful sweet. You can have the rest.
Hellion,,item_the_wine,"Now <i>this</i> is wine! Come, enjoy with me!"
Runaway,,item_the_wine,This is real high-born stuff. Have a sip.
Leper,,item_the_wine,I thought I'd never savour such a vintage again...
,,item_tug_rope,Let's test our strength!
Occultist,,item_tug_rope,A true test of the will!
Man-at-arms,,item_tug_rope,Who will fall behind me?!
Plague Doctor,,item_tug_rope,I will ensure that the weight is distributed evenly!
Grave Robber,,item_tug_rope,I suppose if it makes you lot happy.
Highwayman,,item_tug_rope,Loser takes first watch!
Jester,,item_tug_rope,My beanpole frame for victory!
Bounty Hunter,,item_tug_rope,Let's go.
Hellion,,item_tug_rope,Rrrragh! Hold on tight!
Runaway,,item_tug_rope,Eh. Rope burns aren't the <i>fun</i> kind.
Leper,,item_tug_rope,Who dares challenge the mighty leper?
,,item_wax_innoculant,Supposed to ward off the pestilence.
Occultist,,item_wax_innoculant,Viral spirits are not fond of this.
Man-at-arms,,item_wax_innoculant,No battlefield plague will befall me now.
Plague Doctor,,item_wax_innoculant,This should seal out any miasma!
Grave Robber,,item_wax_innoculant,Essential for pestilential catacombs.
Highwayman,,item_wax_innoculant,Horrible miasmas in these times.
Jester,,item_wax_innoculant,Whatever keeps the voice box clean.
Bounty Hunter,,item_wax_innoculant,Can't get sick.
Hellion,,item_wax_innoculant,Much unclean prey in these wastes.
Runaway,,item_wax_innoculant,Can't keep moving if you're sick.
Leper,,item_wax_innoculant,One wasting illness is enough.
,,item_whetstone,A dull blade will doom us.
Occultist,,item_whetstone,A soothing yet productive activity.
Man-at-arms,,item_whetstone,A little honing goes a long way.
Plague Doctor,,item_whetstone,A scalpel must have a perfect edge.
Grave Robber,,item_whetstone,So sharp I can slice silk.
Highwayman,,item_whetstone,Five strokes should do.
Jester,,item_whetstone,"I prefer to lop, not hack."
Bounty Hunter,,item_whetstone,There's a notch in my axe...
Hellion,,item_whetstone,A clan is only as strong as its weakest blade.
Runaway,,item_whetstone,Time to sharpen up the ol' rib-sticker.
Leper,,item_whetstone,Why club when I can cleave?
,,item_whiskey_barrel,There's enough for all and myself a little more.
Occultist,,item_whiskey_barrel,I will not drink from the spigot.
Man-at-arms,,item_whiskey_barrel,"Stow your arms, time to make merry!"
Plague Doctor,,item_whiskey_barrel,There's more to life than treatises and texts!
Grave Robber,,item_whiskey_barrel,I'll knock back a draught or three!
Highwayman,,item_whiskey_barrel,"Well, let's do it up proper then!"
Jester,,item_whiskey_barrel,Let's gather round for... A round...
Bounty Hunter,,item_whiskey_barrel,Revelry?
Hellion,,item_whiskey_barrel,Drink fortifies the spirit!
Runaway,,item_whiskey_barrel,... Maybe we can relax for one night.
Leper,,item_whiskey_barrel,Life is short and often cruel. Revel when you can.
,,item_whiskey_bottle,Who else wants a pull?
Occultist,,item_whiskey_bottle,Dulling the mind is a necessary ritual.
Man-at-arms,,item_whiskey_bottle,A bottle for compatriots!
Plague Doctor,,item_whiskey_bottle,"Oh, it burns!"
Grave Robber,,item_whiskey_bottle,Barely worth sharing.
Highwayman,,item_whiskey_bottle,"I don't usually share, but..."
Jester,,item_whiskey_bottle,"Finally, a drinking <i>and</i> singing partner!"
Bounty Hunter,,item_whiskey_bottle,Don't hog it.
Hellion,,item_whiskey_bottle,Share my drink? Hmph. Only since you asked.
Runaway,,item_whiskey_bottle,Sharing food and drink? ... Strange. But... okay.
Leper,,item_whiskey_bottle,A shared bottle is a bridge built. Or mended.
,,item_whiskey_flask,How delightful the warmth that spreads.
Occultist,,item_whiskey_flask,I only drink it for the flavour.
Man-at-arms,,item_whiskey_flask,I used to have three or four stashed in my britches for battle.
Plague Doctor,,item_whiskey_flask,Isn't this a disinfectant?
Grave Robber,,item_whiskey_flask,Why not?
Highwayman,,item_whiskey_flask,Always gone too fast.
Jester,,item_whiskey_flask,A nip to loosen over-tight strings.
Bounty Hunter,,item_whiskey_flask,Does the trick.
Hellion,,item_whiskey_flask,Barely a whelp's gulp in here!
Runaway,,item_whiskey_flask,Usually prefer to keep a clear head...
Leper,,item_whiskey_flask,I'll take this back in the Stagecoach.
,,item_whittling_tools,I'm making a duck.
Occultist,,item_whittling_tools,Mundane activities to soothe the mind.
Man-at-arms,,item_whittling_tools,This takes me back to my childhood.
Plague Doctor,,item_whittling_tools,Even the mind requires rest.
Grave Robber,,item_whittling_tools,Have to kill time somehow.
Highwayman,,item_whittling_tools,I did this as a boy.
Jester,,item_whittling_tools,Give me some time and I'll have made a new lute.
Bounty Hunter,,item_whittling_tools,Might cut myself.
Hellion,,item_whittling_tools,Anyone have a larger knife?
Runaway,,item_whittling_tools,Busy hands soothe the nerves.
Leper,,item_whittling_tools,What's the sport if I can't feel the misses?
,,item_wild_tea,Gulp generously and prepare for a journey of the mind.
Occultist,,item_wild_tea,How odd - my mind both loosens and sharpens...!
Man-at-arms,,item_wild_tea,I say... is the floor moving? Ha!
Plague Doctor,,item_wild_tea,I used this to enhance my memory while studying.
Grave Robber,,item_wild_tea,"A rare indulgence, to let so loose. Why not?"
Highwayman,,item_wild_tea,"I feel... oddly relaxed, yet awake. Huh."
Jester,,item_wild_tea,They say symphonies are written on this stuff.
Bounty Hunter,,item_wild_tea,"Eyes feel sharper. Ears, too. Hmm."
Hellion,,item_wild_tea,Let us sit and commune with our kin departed.
Runaway,,item_wild_tea,I dunno about this. Leaves one defenseless...
Leper,,item_wild_tea,Like reaches out to like. Connections. Beauty. Hope.
Jester,,item_oddly_tuned_lute,"Liven up, would you?"
Jester,,item_oddly_tuned_lute,I love a captive audience.
Jester,,item_oddly_tuned_lute,*harmonious humming*
Occultist,,item_oddly_tuned_lute,What an oddly pleasing resonance...
Man-at-arms,,item_oddly_tuned_lute,Your hands are made of stern stuff!
Plague Doctor,,item_oddly_tuned_lute,Fascinating! My boot taps of its own accord!
Grave Robber,,item_oddly_tuned_lute,I performed this gavotte as a girl...
Highwayman,,item_oddly_tuned_lute,Feels nice. Feels... normal.
Bounty Hunter,,item_oddly_tuned_lute,Nice try. Still ain't singing.
Hellion,,item_oddly_tuned_lute,Needs drums.
Runaway,,item_oddly_tuned_lute,Huh. Been ages since I heard music.
Leper,,item_oddly_tuned_lute,Music often reaches where medicine cannot.
Highwayman,,item_morbid_joke,You ever hear the one about the chandler...?
Highwayman,,item_morbid_joke,What's red and bad fer your teeth? ... A brick.
Highwayman,,item_morbid_joke,Dark humour is like food. Not everyone gets it.
Occultist,,item_morbid_joke,You certainly have a way with words.
Man-at-arms,,item_morbid_joke,"I've heard worse, lad."
Plague Doctor,,item_morbid_joke,Ehm. Was that the punchline?
Grave Robber,,item_morbid_joke,"That's nothing, darling. How about the one..."
Jester,,item_morbid_joke,... ... ... Heh.
Bounty Hunter,,item_morbid_joke,*snort*
Hellion,,item_morbid_joke,Ha HAH!
Runaway,,item_morbid_joke,I... I don't get it.
Leper,,item_morbid_joke,If this helps you pass the time...
Man-at-arms,,item_improvised_strategy,"Right, you all listen here..."
Man-at-arms,,item_improvised_strategy,"Gather 'round the map, now..."
Man-at-arms,,item_improvised_strategy,At last! A path to victory!
Occultist,,item_improvised_strategy,Persuasive.
Plague Doctor,,item_improvised_strategy,Riveting! I follow your logic.
Grave Robber,,item_improvised_strategy,*yawwwwn* 'Course I'm listening.
Highwayman,,item_improvised_strategy,Hm. Seems sensible enough.
Jester,,item_improvised_strategy,"Ah, forethought, my old nemesis."
Bounty Hunter,,item_improvised_strategy,Solid plan.
Hellion,,item_improvised_strategy,Too much talking.
Runaway,,item_improvised_strategy,Can't we just try to sneak through?
Leper,,item_improvised_strategy,The prepared mind slumbers peacefully.
Plague Doctor,,item_experimental_remedy,Fret not - these always fizz!
Plague Doctor,,item_experimental_remedy,You may feel a slight tingling...!
Plague Doctor,,item_experimental_remedy,"No, it hasn't gone off. That's the sulfur."
Occultist,,item_experimental_remedy,I dearly hope my sense of smell recovers.
Man-at-arms,,item_experimental_remedy,Can't be choosy with field medicine.
Grave Robber,,item_experimental_remedy,I'd swear she enjoys subjecting us to this.
Highwayman,,item_experimental_remedy,Pass it here. This journey's wearin' me down.
Jester,,item_experimental_remedy,You're <i>hilarious</i>.
Bounty Hunter,,item_experimental_remedy,Long as it works...
Hellion,,item_experimental_remedy,What foul spirits! Yet refreshing!
Runaway,,item_experimental_remedy,<i>Ugggghhh.</i> I feel queasy.
Leper,,item_experimental_remedy,Perhaps wasted on one such as I...
Leper,,item_precious_collection,I will likely never see the shores of home again.
Leper,,item_precious_collection,Some memories weigh in the pocket - others are lighter.
Leper,,item_precious_collection,We will never forget that which we can touch.
Occultist,,item_precious_collection,I too hold on to some remnants of a former life...
Man-at-arms,,item_precious_collection,Pretty trinkets.
Plague Doctor,,item_precious_collection,These seem inert. What do they...<i>do?</i>
Grave Robber,,item_precious_collection,"Mm, you've got a story, don't you?"
Highwayman,,item_precious_collection,"Bold man, carrying the past around."
Jester,,item_precious_collection,Shiny.
Bounty Hunter,,item_precious_collection,These look expensive.
Hellion,,item_precious_collection,Talismans hold power.
Runaway,,item_precious_collection,"Oh wow, where'd you get these? They're beautiful!"
Runaway,,item_tar_filled_colambre,Heh heh. They never see me coming.
Runaway,,item_tar_filled_colambre,More fun than wine.
Runaway,,item_tar_filled_colambre,You're going to burn so hot...
Occultist,,item_guided_meditation,Walk with me. Let me take you to the outer spheres...
Occultist,,item_guided_meditation,Let us travel both time and space.
Occultist,,item_guided_meditation,Who knows what we might discover?
Man-at-arms,,item_guided_meditation,Can't say I've done <i>this</i> before...
Plague Doctor,,item_guided_meditation,I remain skeptical. However...
Grave Robber,,item_guided_meditation,What if we... see... something?
Highwayman,,item_guided_meditation,Don't normally travel with a guide.
Jester,,item_guided_meditation,"Here, I'll strum a few notes..."
Bounty Hunter,,item_guided_meditation,This is new.
Hellion,,item_guided_meditation,Our spirit guides would smoke this stuff...
Runaway,,item_guided_meditation,I don't know... I don't like letting go.
Leper,,item_guided_meditation,I will walk with you. Let us step beyond ourselves.
Grave Robber,,item_the_very_best,"Bottoms up, love."
Grave Robber,,item_the_very_best,T'your health and pleasure.
Grave Robber,,item_the_very_best,May we profit while our enemies suffer.
Hellion,,item_war_paint,Mmm. Smells like my first hunt.
Hellion,,item_war_paint,These flowers don't grow around here...
Hellion,,item_war_paint,Mother. Let me do your colours proud.
,,item_medicinal_leeches,Even the medicine hungers for my blood.
Man-at-arms,,item_medicinal_leeches,Flinch not! Merely some blood... Errgh.
Plague Doctor,,item_medicinal_leeches,I recognize this species! Adequate at best.
Grave Robber,,item_medicinal_leeches,Is my countenance so wan?
Highwayman,,item_medicinal_leeches,I like my blood where it is.
Jester,,item_medicinal_leeches,Think that one's lookin' at me.
Hellion,,item_medicinal_leeches,Is this... food?
Occultist,,item_medicinal_leeches,"A dated technique, but sometimes effective."
Runaway,,item_medicinal_leeches,"Fine. I'll let you, but I won't like it."
Leper,,item_medicinal_leeches,Ah. We meet again.
Bounty Hunter,,item_medicinal_leeches,So be it.
,,story_assist_torch_1,A little help is the least we can offer.
,,story_assist_torch_2,A little assistance goes a long way!
,,story_assist_torch_3,Good deeds quiet the whispers.
,,story_assist_torch_4,I foresee no negative consequences should we assist.
,,story_assist_torch_5,They have struck a chord in my cold black heart.
,,story_assist_torch_6,A tale or maybe a song is all these poor folk need!
,,story_assist_torch_7,Let us be true heroes!
,,story_assist_torch_8,Let's help.
,,story_assist_torch_9,"Could be us needing a hand tomorrow, I guess."
,,story_assist_torch_10,Bright seeds planted in dark soil always bear fruit.
,,story_assist_supplies_01,"It's a long, hungry road. Fancy a trade?"
,,story_assist_supplies_02,Never one to turn down a meal.
,,story_assist_supplies_03,Hard work soothes the unquiet mind.
,,story_assist_supplies_04,Hmph. Beats another supper of slime mould.
,,story_assist_supplies_05,I'm loath to admit their peasant victuals tempt me.
,,story_assist_supplies_06,I'm able. I'm hungry. Let's barter.
,,story_assist_supplies_07,Dirty hands feed the spirit <i>and</i> the belly.
,,story_assist_supplies_08,Better eating than on the coach.
,,story_assist_supplies_09,We'd be fools not to help if food's on the table.
,,story_assist_supplies_10,I am not too proud for the plow. Let us aid them.
,,story_assist_combat_supplies_01,"I was a nobody with a blade once, too."
,,story_assist_combat_supplies_02,They face these fiends with shovels - that's grit.
,,story_assist_combat_supplies_03,We should aid any who forestall the abyss.
,,story_assist_combat_supplies_04,Tinctures? Powders? Shall we swap?
,,story_assist_combat_supplies_05,"Oh, look at you scrappy things. Need a hand?"
,,story_assist_combat_supplies_06,They are either insane or an inspiration.
,,story_assist_combat_supplies_07,Such fighting spirit! I lend you my arm.
,,story_assist_combat_supplies_08,There's fight in these folks yet.
,,story_assist_combat_supplies_09,We can help if you make it worth our while.
,,story_assist_combat_supplies_10,The herds on the plains know strength in numbers.
,,story_assist_standard_101,A promise of reward? Let's help them.
,,story_assist_standard_102,Mercenaries can do more than kill.
,,story_assist_standard_103,An energy exchange will benefit us all.
,,story_assist_standard_104,My sums indicate this effort pays for itself.
,,story_assist_standard_105,Who am I to resist some needed supplies and a good deed done?
,,story_assist_standard_106,The timbre of full barrels better suits my music. Let's help.
,,story_assist_standard_107,I'd help for nothing but your goods are a fair turn.
,,story_assist_standard_108,If they're paying...
,,story_assist_standard_109,We'll eat better tonight if we help 'em.
,,story_assist_standard_110,Some harvests yield beyond the sweat paid.
,,story_assist_standard_201,I've got just the tale to brighten their hearts!
,,story_assist_standard_301,Our journey has been a fount for inspiring anecdotes!
,,story_assist_inspire_1,These people need hope more than anything.
,,story_assist_inspire_2,Good morale is stronger than any steel.
,,story_assist_inspire_3,Uplifting words hold more power than almost any spell.
,,story_assist_inspire_4,We can prove to them that they can survive.
,,story_assist_inspire_5,Encouragement costs nothing.
,,story_assist_inspire_6,Let us turn some smiles upside down. Frowns. I meant frowns.
,,story_assist_inspire_7,A cheerful fire and some ale is all these folk need.
,,story_assist_inspire_8,Ale? Whiskey? I ain't singing.
,,story_assist_inspire_9,Someone helped me once...
,,story_assist_inspire_10,"Friends gained today, become allies when needed."
,,story_assist_inspire_101,We cannot let others fall while we succeed!
,,story_assist_inspire_102,Our swagger will rouse their spirits!
,,story_assist_inspire_103,We have a tangible brilliance that will uplift them.
,,story_assist_inspire_104,Humans tend to exude positive airs in brighter climes.
,,story_assist_inspire_105,I could dazzle them with some knife tricks!
,,story_assist_inspire_106,"I was just practicing with 5 balls, on with the show!"
,,story_assist_inspire_107,Our hope was meant to be shared!
,,story_assist_inspire_108,Let's have. Fun.
,,story_assist_inspire_109,"Take a tiny spark, tend it, watch it swell...!"
,,story_assist_inspire_110,Brilliance shared is brilliance that stands the test of time.
,,story_assist_inspire_201,"There is little hope on the road, but still it falls on us to help."
,,story_assist_inspire_202,Our torch fizzles but we must stoke their fires!
,,story_assist_inspire_203,It only takes a spark to warm those without hope.
,,story_assist_inspire_204,Great fires require very little fuel to start.
,,story_assist_inspire_205,"I know what it's like to be hopeless, we must try."
,,story_assist_inspire_206,I was born to uplift.
,,story_assist_inspire_207,We must bring them the hope that we cannot scrounge for ourselves.
,,story_assist_inspire_208,Be foolish not to if they're paying.
,,story_assist_inspire_209,"When the flame's low, that's when they need us most..."
,,story_assist_inspire_210,Should I take off my mask? Children love that.
,,story_assist_donate_101,The road is hard but we can show mercy.
,,story_assist_donate_102,Let's ease their burden!
,,story_assist_donate_103,Better we lose a few relics than our humanity.
,,story_assist_donate_104,Relics have no scientific value.
,,story_assist_donate_105,They desire our relics? *sigh* If we must.
,,story_assist_donate_106,Few sing about relics but all celebrate good deeds!
,,story_assist_donate_107,Relics attract fools and thieves.
,,story_assist_donate_108,I prefer coin anyhow.
,,story_assist_donate_109,Can't buy hope with trinkets.
,,story_assist_donate_110,Charity lightens the soul's burden.
,,story_assist_donate_201,We're a jingling target - we can spare some loot.
,,story_assist_donate_202,"They need relics, we need resupply."
,,story_assist_donate_203,"Ointments, powder, better use to us than relics."
,,story_assist_donate_204,What good are baubles if we bleed out?
,,story_assist_donate_205,"Ugh, fine. But only the semiprecious stones."
,,story_assist_donate_206,"How novel, charity."
,,story_assist_donate_207,These trinkets only weigh us down.
,,story_assist_donate_208,Heh. Seems fair.
,,story_assist_donate_209,We should be traveling lighter anyhow.
,,story_assist_donate_210,Gold matters not where we are headed.
,,story_assist_donate_301,Let's see what they can trade us for our few relics.
,,story_assist_donate_302,We can trade with the little we have.
,,story_assist_donate_303,A true hero gives when the coffers are low.
,,story_assist_donate_304,Better something useful than a handful of relics.
,,story_assist_donate_401,"Wealth will only delude us, why not give some away?"
,,story_assist_donate_501,"All wealth is a curse! Take it, take it all!"
,,story_assist_exert_101,Let's roll up our sleeves then.
,,story_assist_exert_102,Let's push them out of the mud!
,,story_assist_exert_103,"Physical labour, why not?"
,,story_assist_exert_104,Leverage will make it easier!
,,story_assist_exert_105,Is that mud? Oh well.
,,story_assist_exert_106,"I'll beat the drum, you do the pushing!"
,,story_assist_exert_107,I can probably do it myself!
,,story_assist_exert_108,Let's push.
,,story_assist_exert_109,All right! On three! One... two...
,,story_assist_exert_110,If Fate decrees we help...
,,story_assist_exert_201,Nothing like a little labor to clear the mind!
,,story_assist_exert_202,Physical labour can relieve our worries for a while.
,,story_assist_exert_203,Time to balance mental labour with physical labour.
,,story_assist_exert_204,"I hope we can find purchase, that mud looks viscous."
,,story_assist_exert_205,First one in the mud buys the first round!
,,story_assist_exert_206,Not many know but a lute can serve as a first class shovel!
,,story_assist_exert_207,Which of you weaklings will tire first?
,,story_assist_exert_208,*sigh*
,,story_assist_exert_209,"Careful, it's mucky out there."
,,story_assist_exert_210,"The task is presented, the action is obvious."
,,story_assist_exert_301,What's a little elbow grease?
,,story_assist_exert_302,Form up and push!
,,story_assist_exert_401,Their problems are our problems! Let's help!
,,story_assist_exert_501,We have the means to help the helpless!
,,story_assist_stealfood_101,We must survive. Let's take their food.
,,story_assist_stealfood_102,Morals are the first to die in battle.
,,story_assist_stealfood_103,The best way to know evil is to become it.
,,story_assist_stealfood_104,"Without enforcement of laws, there are no crimes."
,,story_assist_stealfood_105,I will steal anything from anyone.
,,story_assist_stealfood_106,"Better to steal from kings, but I'm <i>hungry.</i>"
,,story_assist_stealfood_107,These weaklings! What's theirs is ours!
,,story_assist_stealfood_108,"If we don't survive this, who will?"
,,story_assist_stealfood_109,We'll help <i>everyone</i> better if we're not starving.
,,story_assist_stealfood_110,Sometimes pawns must fall so the king can triumph.
,,story_assist_stealfood_301,See this pistol? That food belongs to us!
,,story_assist_stealfood_302,"We will face even greater skirmishes, take the food!"
,,story_assist_stealfood_303,Who should eat? Peasants or heroes?
,,story_assist_stealfood_304,"Cough up, we are not in the mood for games."
,,story_assist_stealfood_305,We're well beyond the point of begging.
,,story_assist_stealfood_306,No hope. No food. No song. No Dance.
,,story_assist_stealfood_307,I will not starve again.
,,story_assist_stealfood_308,Hungry and angry.
,,story_assist_stealfood_309,Don't make us ask twice.
,,story_assist_stealfood_310,Judgment may come but my stomach needs filling
,,story_assist_stealfood_601,Let's just take their meal!
,,story_assist_stealrelics_101,This pistol is loaded.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_102,Pass over that chest or we will crush you.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_103,"Hand it over, or I'll open your eyes to horrors unseen."
,,story_assist_stealrelics_104,Pass over your wealth.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_105,No one needs to get hurt.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_106,"Relics, relics, relics, now."
,,story_assist_stealrelics_107,I'll take that!
,,story_assist_stealrelics_108,Don't make me use the hook.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_109,I'm not leaving empty-handed.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_110,"We are not evil, just desperate paupers."
,,story_assist_stealrelics_201,This is what I do best.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_202,It's for the greater good.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_203,Material sins dissolve upon death.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_204,This can be transmuted into benefit for all! Probably.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_205,"Put the goods in the bag, loves."
,,story_assist_stealrelics_206,I like to rhyme and commit crime.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_207,Better relics than your fingers!
,,story_assist_stealrelics_208,In the sack. Now.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_209,You won't like us when we're desperate.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_210,Please do not make us hurt you.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_301,What's yours is now mine.
,,story_assist_stealrelics_302,Is your life worth a few baubles?
,,story_assist_stealrelics_401,You're in no position to negotiate.
,,story_assist_slay_101,"A dagger for your throat, a pistol for your eye."
,,story_assist_slay_102,Let's run them through!
,,story_assist_slay_103,Save me their blood for my rituals.
,,story_assist_slay_104,Keep one alive. I have a theory to investigate.
,,story_assist_slay_105,"Theft is a lark, but I do enjoy a good murder."
,,story_assist_slay_106,"Ah screams and lamentations, my favourite melody."
,,story_assist_slay_107,Let's kill!
,,story_assist_slay_108,Quickly. Silently. No survivors.
,,story_assist_slay_109,Fire hungers for fuel.
,,story_assist_slay_110,Too long have I stifled the screams of my shadow.
,,story_assist_slay_301,I'm in the mood for murder.
,,story_assist_slay_401,Death is what makes life so grand.
,,story_assist_avoid_101,An inconvenience this is.
,,story_assist_avoid_102,True tacticians avoid these kinds of inefficiencies.
,,story_assist_avoid_103,The moon is not right for this.
,,story_assist_avoid_104,My studies do not spare me the luxury of time.
,,story_assist_avoid_105,Yawn.
,,story_assist_avoid_106,Just as my lute is finally in tune.
,,story_assist_avoid_107,"No blood, no thunder."
,,story_assist_avoid_108,And risk an ambush? No.
,,story_assist_avoid_109,We can't afford to slow down for this...!
,,story_assist_avoid_110,Fate has not granted me enough hours for this diversion.
,,story_assist_avoid_201,What can we spare? Nothing.
,,story_assist_avoid_202,We might do more harm than good now.
,,story_assist_avoid_203,All for what?
,,story_assist_avoid_204,There's no proof we can help.
,,story_assist_avoid_205,I haven't finished my drink.
,,story_assist_avoid_206,No point in playing when the lute's out of tune.
,,story_assist_avoid_207,There's a limit to what we can do.
,,story_assist_avoid_208,We ought to look out for us.
,,story_assist_avoid_209,Hmph. They'll only get in our way.
,,story_assist_avoid_210,We might taint them with our dark fate.
,,story_assist_avoid_301,I'm inclined to decline.
,,story_assist_avoid_401,The Stagecoach is so warm and cozy right now.
,,story_assist_avoid_501,We owe these people nothing.
,,story_assist_stealfood_104,"Without enforcement of laws, there are no crimes."
,,story_assist_stealfood_105,I will steal anything from anyone.

,,story_assist_stealfood_110,Sometimes pawns must fall so the king can triumph.
,,story_assist_stealfood_201,Our ration barrels ring hollow.
,,story_assist_stealfood_202,Our stomachs have been grumbling for ages it seems.
,,story_assist_stealfood_203,Why should they feast while we starve?
,,story_assist_stealfood_204,"We need food, your food."
,,story_assist_stealfood_205,"Give us supplies, we're starving."
,,story_assist_stealfood_206,Are those supplies for us?
,,story_assist_stealfood_207,That roast chicken smells delightful.
,,story_assist_stealfood_208,Pass it over.
,,story_assist_stealfood_209,I've done worse to get by.
,,story_assist_stealfood_210,Fate twists us against each other in times of need.
,,story_assist_stealfood_301,See this pistol? That food belongs to us!
,,story_assist_stealfood_302,"We will face even greater skirmishes, take the food!"

,,story_assist_stealfood_401,Take their bread!
,,story_assist_stealfood_402,We may bleed but we don't have to starve!
,,story_assist_stealfood_403,Kismet be damned! Give us your food!
,,story_assist_stealfood_404,How can we heal if we can't eat?
,,story_assist_stealfood_405,"I intend to survive, not bleed out on the road!"
,,story_assist_stealfood_406,"Buzzards circling, lifeblood dripping. Feed us."
,,story_assist_stealfood_407,This is a question of survival!
,,story_assist_stealfood_408,Take their rations!
,,story_assist_stealfood_409,It's them or us. I won't go hungry again.
,,story_assist_stealfood_410,"Buzzards circle over the Stagecoach, take the bread!"

,,story_creature_den_fight_04,The wildlife here has certainly grown curious.
,,story_creature_den_fight_05,A rank hole in the ground? Folly.

,,story_creature_den_advantage_dardevil_101,"Make your graves, foul creatures!"
,,story_creature_den_advantage_bloodthirsty_101,Your entrails will fall in ribbons at my feet!
,,story_creature_den_flee_01,We don't know their numbers. Fall back.
,,story_creature_den_flee_02,This terrain favours us not.
,,story_creature_den_flee_03,My spine prickles. Let us away.
,,story_creature_den_flee_04,I will not fall as some beast's supper!
,,story_creature_den_flee_05,"... Deep underground, that lair."
,,story_creature_den_flee_06,Surely we've more interesting foes ahead.
,,story_creature_den_flee_07,"Spirits cleanse this place, not us!"
,,story_creature_den_flee_08,We're moving downwind. They'll smell us coming.
,,story_creature_den_flee_09,And die down there like a stew rabbit?
,,story_creature_den_flee_10,"We hunt the corruption, not its mewling pups."
,,story_creature_den_flee_100,And lose our last light down there?
,,story_creature_den_flee_101,"The Cult nips at our heels, we must continue!"
,,story_creature_den_flee_102,Darkness draws closer - must we risk it?
,,story_creature_den_flee_401,To do so would drive me mad!
,,story_creature_den_flee_402,Can you not see I am drenched in my life's blood??
,,story_creature_den_flee_low_health_01,The stench of our blood will draw more...
,,story_creature_den_flee_low_health_02,"Face unknown numbers, in this state?"
,,story_creature_den_flee_low_health_03,I waver on my feet - we tempt fate!
,,story_creature_den_flee_cowardice_01,The howls from within chill my blood!
,,story_creature_den_flee_zoophobia_01,"Their rolling eyes, their slavering jaws - no! NO!!"
,,story_creature_den_flee_city_01,"That midden heap smell, my stomach churns...!"
,,story_creature_den_flee_forest_01,Such horrors defy the order of nature!
,,story_creature_den_flee_farm_01,The reek of their breath is too near already!
,,story_creature_den_flee_cave_01,You cannot compel me to face such terrors!
,,story_creature_den_resist_high_torch_01,See? Our light cows them.
,,story_creature_den_resist_high_torch_02,We ought to save our strength.
,,story_creature_den_resist_high_torch_03,Make haste while they slumber!
,,story_herostory_HWY_01,Walls will never again hold me.
,,story_herostory_HWY_02,Freedom was nothing like what I'd hoped for.
,,story_herostory_HWY_03,Can't teach an old dog new tricks.
,,story_herostory_HWY_04,Was I desperate? Yes. Was I greedy...?
,,story_herostory_HWY_05,Regret binds fiercer than any manacles.
,,story_herostory_HWY_06,I am stronger for having relived my past.
,,story_herostory_MAA_01,My ambition outflanked my fellow officers at soirees and mock skirmishes.
,,story_herostory_MAA_02,Clever repartee and a poison tongue meant nothing on the battlefield.
,,story_herostory_MAA_03,Were they dreams or did I truly see scratches on my arms in the morning?
,,story_herostory_MAA_04,"I knew what waited for me back there, but I had no rank and they deserved rest."
,,story_herostory_MAA_05,"Someday, on some forgotten front, I'll spell contrition with my blood."
,,story_herostory_MAA_06,I am stronger for having relived my past.
,,story_herostory_OCC_01,Few minds are ready for the other planes.
,,story_herostory_OCC_02,That pyramid changed everything.
,,story_herostory_OCC_03,"Back then, I was not yet wise enough to know fear."
,,story_herostory_OCC_04,"I took too much and gained even more, but..."
,,story_herostory_OCC_05,I am shrouded by an endless night where they prowl and whisper all names.
,,story_herostory_OCC_06,I am stronger for having relived my past.
,,story_herostory_PD_01,"The jeers, the whispers... they pushed me deep into my studies."
,,story_herostory_PD_02,"I was the smartest, but wisdom was not on the syllabus."
,,story_herostory_PD_03,"Ostracized, I had to prove myself, no matter the cost."
,,story_herostory_PD_04,"I could not say if it was madness, revenge, or naked ambition."
,,story_herostory_PD_05,Those screams will never leave me.
,,story_herostory_PD_06,I am stronger for having relived my past.
,,story_herostory_GR_01,"Tradition drove us into each other's arms. Or estates, rather."
,,story_herostory_GR_02,What did Fate expect as she flogged me towards vindictive action?
,,story_herostory_GR_03,"I cannot say I recommend impulsive murder. Always make a plan, love."
,,story_herostory_GR_04,He meant to leave me as a pauper or a corpse eventually. I'm certain.
,,story_herostory_GR_05,What use have the dead for such trinkets and baubles?
,,story_herostory_GR_06,I am stronger for having relived my past.
,,story_herostory_JES_01,That accursed melody was a trap beyond all cunning.
,,story_herostory_JES_02,That song found ambition buried dead in my heart and made it dance...
,,story_herostory_JES_03,And so the trap snapped shut on me.
,,story_herostory_JES_04,"Just as it was meant to, the song loosed the leash of my inhibitions..."
,,story_herostory_JES_05,Ask any animal if it was worth it to gnaw off a limb for freedom.
,,story_herostory_JES_06,I am stronger for having relived my past.
,,story_herostory_HEL_01,I was too young. Too loud... too certain...
,,story_herostory_HEL_02,The invaders came. And with them came countless fears.
,,story_herostory_HEL_03,I had no more courage than the buzzards feasting on my failure.
,,story_herostory_HEL_04,I had survived and I reminded them of those who had not.
,,story_herostory_HEL_05,It is said even Death shuns cowards and fools.
,,story_herostory_HEL_06,I am stronger for having relived my past.
,,story_herostory_LEP_01,"A lion in the blood-soaked grass, circled by hyenas who move as a pack..."
,,story_herostory_LEP_02,A hollow clanging echoed throughout the palace.
,,story_herostory_LEP_03,"With wicked plots, they forged the blade that slew them."
,,story_herostory_LEP_04,Fury and blade to excise malignance - no matter the agony!
,,story_herostory_LEP_05,"Ever present, sunlight throws aside the clouds to pour into the people's hearts."
,,story_herostory_LEP_06,I am stronger for having relived my past.
,,story_herostory_BH_01,<snort>
,,story_herostory_RUN_01,I only felt the pain from the brand the first time.
,,story_herostory_RUN_02,My painful memories hid from the warmth of their love.
,,story_herostory_RUN_03,How could this thing that warmed us on cold nights be terrible?
,,story_herostory_RUN_04,"If I made the fire my friend, it couldn't hurt me anymore."
,,story_herostory_RUN_05,Fire itself is not evil. It can't choose what it devours...

,,story_oasis_standard_1,Been ages since I had a scrub.
,,story_oasis_standard_2,"Ahh, time to give these old bones a soak."
,,story_oasis_standard_3,"Now, for somewhere dry to hang my robes..."
,,story_oasis_standard_4,Cleanliness balances the humours!
,,story_oasis_standard_5,"Well. No heat, no salts, no wine - but it shall suffice."
,,story_oasis_standard_6,Something reeks most foul. Is it me?
,,story_oasis_standard_7,Our foes may lose our scent if we bathe...
,,story_oasis_standard_8,Hm. Alright.
,,story_oasis_standard_9,Only if someone's keeping watch on the coach...
,,story_oasis_standard_10,Never underestimate the power of a moment's respite.
,,story_oasis_supplies_1,"Can't afford to tarry, let's fill a bottle or two."
,,story_oasis_supplies_2,We'll wet our whistles on the road.
,,story_oasis_supplies_3,I sense we are needed in haste - I'll fill a flask.
,,story_oasis_supplies_4,Did... did you hear that? Fill our skins and go!
,,story_oasis_supplies_5,Pity we haven't the luxury of time.
,,story_oasis_supplies_6,"*glug* Oh, look. My flask has run dry."
,,story_oasis_supplies_7,Fill our barrels and let's be on!
,,story_oasis_supplies_8,"Quickly, now."
,,story_oasis_supplies_9,"Stock up, but don't dawdle! We don't have time!"
,,story_oasis_supplies_10,"Overlook no blessing, however small."
,,story_oasis_rare_1,Lucky us. Let's bottle what we can and rinse up.
,,story_oasis_rare_2,Take reprieve when it's offered.
,,story_oasis_rare_3,Only fools waste water.
,,story_oasis_rare_4,"Some for our gullets, some for ablutions."
,,story_oasis_rare_5,"Don't gawk if you value your eyes, loves."
,,story_oasis_rare_6,We shall march to our deaths smelling of soap.
,,story_oasis_rare_7,A clear spring is a gift from the Gods. Drink up.
,,story_oasis_rare_8,Mask's stayin' on.
,,story_oasis_rare_9,Is it safe...? Alright. If you keep watch.
,,story_oasis_rare_10,Peace pays us a brief visit. I'll stand guard.
,,story_oasis_rummager,I've been saving up empties for such an occasion!
,,story_oasis_compassionate,Fortune smiles. Drink up and rest your bones!
,,story_oasis_field surgeon,"Come, come, let me wash your wounds."
,,story_oasis_avoid_101,"A distraction, this is."
,,story_oasis_avoid_102,Caught the runs from this stuff on campaign once.
,,story_oasis_avoid_103,Is it wise to waste our dwindling torchlight here?
,,story_oasis_avoid_104,I've far more important matters to attend.
,,story_oasis_avoid_105,You're proposing I <i>wash my hair</i> in this gunge?
,,story_oasis_avoid_106,And risk making myself ill?
,,story_oasis_avoid_107,I fought hard for these stains. Why cleanse them?
,,story_oasis_avoid_108,Could be a trap.
,,story_oasis_avoid_109,"Every moment we stall, they grow nearer."

,,story_resist_flee_203,When darkness closes in it is best to run!
,,story_resist_flee_801,We are already limping!
,,story_resist_flee_301,Our stitches will require stitches!
,,story_resist_flee_302,And slip on our own blood as we advance?
,,story_resist_flee_303,We cannot fight with these wounds!
,,story_resist_flee_501,To do so would drive me mad!

,,story_resist_flee_nocost_01,If we move quickly we can avoid any trouble!
,,story_resist_flee_nocost_02,They won't notice if we slip away now.
,,story_resist_flee_nocost_03,Let's get out of here while we still can!

Hellion,,fear_of_swine_banter,Their squealing sounds like the cry of a human babe!
,,field_surgeon_banter,Should take but a moment to stitch that up!
,,field_surgeon_banter,"Bite down on this, these sutures will sting!"
,,field_surgeon_banter,I'm afraid this might leave yet another scar.
,,field_surgeon_banter,"Steady, now - we must clean these wounds."
,,field_surgeon_banter,"This salve stings, yes, but an infection would sting worse!"

,,forest_scrounger_banter,A glint of something shiny in the vines - see?
,,forest_scrounger_banter,The remnants of some expedition gone. Ours now.

,,lost_in_time_banter,We've passed that signpost before. I'm certain.
,,lost_in_time_banter,"But...but we left you in the ruins, did we not?"

,,shroud_explorer_banter,"The Shroud has a certain rhythm, not unlike the cold waves that crash here."
,,shroud_explorer_banter,Steady! This driftwood is packed with sharp debris.
,,shroud_explorer_banter,The tides reveal all sorts of trails in the Shroud...
,,shroud_explorer_banter,Their numbers thin when the tide ebbs. Hurry!
,,shroud_scrounger_banter,The Shroud is a bountiful place if you know where to look.

,,shroud_scrounger_banter,"When the tide recedes, it always leaves something behind."
,,shroud_scrounger_banter,"Waterlogged, yes, but this may still be useful."
,,shroud_tactician_banter,I've learned some things dealing with the Fisherfolk...
,,shroud_tactician_banter,Let us cross at low tide. Safer that way.
,,shroud_tactician_banter,This causeway will flood in a king tide. Be wary...

,,slayer_of_cadaver_banter,Shambling about in a parody of life - they haven't a chance.
,,slayer_of_cadaver_banter,"They die quite easily a second time, those corpses."
Bounty Hunter,,slayer_of_cadaver_banter,The bloodless ones go down easy.
,,slayer_of_fanatics_banter,"They are horrible, yes, but they die like anything else."
,,slayer_of_fanatics_banter,They come at us in such frenzy that they leave themselves open.
,,slayer_of_fanatics_banter,Fear the cultists not - they are but flesh and blood.

,,slayer_of_gentry_banter,Don't be afraid to fight dirty - they will.
,,slayer_of_gentry_banter,They are slow and slovenly. Keep light on your toes.
Bounty Hunter,,slayer_of_gentry_banter,A chance to hunt an old client? Hah.
,,slayer_of_swine_banter,Love the way they shriek when we put 'em down.
,,slayer_of_swine_banter,"Remember, the swine are animals - we'll outsmart them."
,,slayer_of_swine_banter,They fear the same things any other beast does.

,,affinity_change_banter_negative,I'm trying to sleep!
,,affinity_change_banter_negative,How about some peace and quiet?
,,affinity_change_banter_negative,This coach is too small and you're too loud.
,,affinity_change_banter_negative,Couldn't care less.
,,affinity_change_banter_negative,Wish we'd never picked you up.
,,affinity_change_banter_negative,Your very presence offends me.
,,affinity_change_banter_negative,Out of my way.
,,affinity_change_banter_negative,This journey is trying enough already.
,,affinity_change_banter_negative,Those rations were mine!
,,affinity_change_banter_negative,Hands to yourself.
,,affinity_change_banter_negative,Something in here reeks.
,,affinity_change_banter_negative,"Cease that humming, ye gods...!"
,,affinity_change_banter_negative,Can I rely on you out there? Not sure.
,,affinity_change_banter_negative,I doubt your mettle.
,,affinity_change_banter_negative,Imbecile!
Highwayman,,node_exit_gate,What fresh hell is this?
Highwayman,,node_exit_gate,Eyes peeled...
Grave Robber,,node_exit_gate,Let's hope we're not spotted.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_gate,Let's be off - quickly!
Occultist,,node_exit_gate,"Around each corner, a new vista of awfulness."
Occultist,,node_exit_gate,Oblivion everywhere!
Hellion,,node_exit_gate,Gods protect us.
Hellion,,node_exit_gate,I'm having a drink.
Jester,,node_exit_gate,The show must go on...
Jester,,node_exit_gate,Let's get this over with.
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_gate,I wonder what we shall find...
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_gate,"Well, we're bound to learn something, at least."
Runaway,,node_exit_gate,I've been in worse places...
Runaway,,node_exit_gate,Let's hope we're not spotted.
Leper,,node_exit_gate,...
Leper,,node_exit_gate,"There is beauty all around, even now."
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_gate,Chaaaarge!
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_gate,Forward - march!
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_gate,A job is a job.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_gate,Keep. Moving.
Highwayman,,node_exit_heroselect,Let's move.
Highwayman,,node_exit_heroselect,The potholes are the least of our concerns.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_heroselect,Cramped quarters to say the least.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_heroselect,Hmph - I'm used to a smoother ride.
Occultist,,node_exit_heroselect,I have glimpsed the nightmares that await us...
Occultist,,node_exit_heroselect,"Onward into oblivion, then."
Hellion,,node_exit_heroselect,Hyaaaah! Let's go already!
Hellion,,node_exit_heroselect,"Let us all find noble deaths, then!"
Jester,,node_exit_heroselect,Let me tune this thing before we get going...
Jester,,node_exit_heroselect,I feel good about this... hehe.
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_heroselect,You will all come to rely on me. I'm sure of it.
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_heroselect,I wonder... which of you will be injured first?
Runaway,,node_exit_heroselect,Once more on the run.
Runaway,,node_exit_heroselect,Keep moving. Don't stop.
Leper,,node_exit_heroselect,"The wheels turn, the earth spins."
Leper,,node_exit_heroselect,I accept this new torment as I would a changing season.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_heroselect,I've been in worse company.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_heroselect,Hah! What a roughcut band we are!
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_heroselect,Let me at 'em.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_heroselect,Onward! Light's fading.
Highwayman,,node_exit_storyassist,Cost us little. Might pay off later.
Highwayman,,node_exit_storyassist,Good luck to 'em.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_storyassist,I suppose it's nice to help the rabble... on occasion.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_storyassist,*gasp* They were positively filthy!
Occultist,,node_exit_storyassist,Every encounter a karmic shift.
Occultist,,node_exit_storyassist,My thoughts are with them.
Hellion,,node_exit_storyassist,On to the next!
Hellion,,node_exit_storyassist,Feh - they should be fighting!
Jester,,node_exit_storyassist,"Heheh. So long, then."
Jester,,node_exit_storyassist,"I found them a bit dull, to be honest."
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_storyassist,They survive despite abhorrent conditions - fascinating.
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_storyassist,Human resilience is truly a marvel.
Runaway,,node_exit_storyassist,We've wasted enough time - let's be off.
Runaway,,node_exit_storyassist,I wonder if they have what it takes to survive.
Leper,,node_exit_storyassist,"Diamonds in the mud, stars in the sky."
Leper,,node_exit_storyassist,Living is a struggle. They understand this.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_storyassist,Poor blighters.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_storyassist,Might make us allies in the long run.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_storyassist,Better make up the lost light.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_storyassist,The horses are stirring...
Highwayman,,node_exit_success_storyresist,It's over. Now get ready for the next fight.
Highwayman,,node_exit_failure_storyresist,That was too close.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_success_storyresist,"Easy enough, I'd say."
Grave Robber,,node_exit_failure_storyresist,A Lady always knows when to make an exit.
Occultist,,node_exit_success_storyresist,Blood will always flow. On this day it wasn't ours.
Occultist,,node_exit_failure_storyresist,I must... meditate. The beast strains at his cage!
Hellion,,node_exit_success_storyresist,"Let's do it again! I'm no coward, I tell you!"
Hellion,,node_exit_failure_storyresist,By the skin of our damned teeth.
Jester,,node_exit_success_storyresist,"Ahh, the melody of murder is on the wind..."
Jester,,node_exit_failure_storyresist,... anyone for a song?
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_success_storyresist,I would have liked a moment to study our attackers' corpses.
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_failure_storyresist,Are you certain we're far enough away...?
Runaway,,node_exit_success_storyresist,We live to fight another day. Maybe less.
Runaway,,node_exit_failure_storyresist,We've gotta get out of here! GO!
Leper,,node_exit_success_storyresist,"Survival begets violence, it would seem."
Leper,,node_exit_failure_storyresist,"Come quickly, lest they track us to the coach."
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_success_storyresist,"Hah! Well fought, all!"
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_failure_storyresist,Retreat! Retreat!
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_success_storyresist,"Ahh, was that so bad?"
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_failure_storyresist,I disguised our tracks. Might buy us time.
Highwayman,,node_exit_hospital,I feel better already. Heh.
Highwayman,,node_exit_hospital,"Stroke of luck, that."
Grave Robber,,node_exit_hospital,Such conditions - my word!
Grave Robber,,node_exit_hospital,Woefully inadequate - and unsanitary!
Occultist,,node_exit_hospital,We leave better than we arrived.
Occultist,,node_exit_hospital,Tending to the wounded as the world burns - noble but futile.
Hellion,,node_exit_hospital,She was skilled in her craft. I respect that.
Hellion,,node_exit_hospital,The horrors she must have faced...
Jester,,node_exit_hospital,She should lighten up a little.
Jester,,node_exit_hospital,Hospitals - all the same.
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_hospital,I suppose one sometimes needs a second opinion.
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_hospital,"I mean, really, it's nothing I couldn't have done!"
Runaway,,node_exit_hospital,Posting up like that? Not for me.
Runaway,,node_exit_hospital,"Glad for the help, but... she's a sitting duck."
Leper,,node_exit_hospital,"Sadly, there is no cure for my condition. Such is the way of things."
Leper,,node_exit_hospital,"Farewell, noble soul. And thank you."
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_hospital,Patched up and ready to bleed again - hah!
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_hospital,Lovely woman. Shame about her eye.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_hospital,Quiet yourselves and let 'em work.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_hospital,She's a tough one.
Highwayman,,node_exit_store,I don't like that creep one bit.
Highwayman,,node_exit_store,I swear I've seen him before someplace...
Grave Robber,,node_exit_store,A little shopping is always a welcome diversion.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_store,That ghastly man - the way he was leering...
Occultist,,node_exit_store,His mind is as jumbled as his merchandise.
Occultist,,node_exit_store,I shudder to think of where he found such a collection.
Hellion,,node_exit_store,He should've just given us what we wanted!
Hellion,,node_exit_store,Weak little weasel of a man - feh!
Jester,,node_exit_store,All that and no accordion? Ridiculous.
Jester,,node_exit_store,"More stuff, eh? Just what we need! Heheh."
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_store,I suppose there were one or two items of interest.
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_store,"Did you hear him mumbling? Truly mad, that one."
Runaway,,node_exit_store,He hardly knew where he was.
Runaway,,node_exit_store,"Where'd he get all that stuff, anyway?"
Leper,,node_exit_store,A mirror reflecting a mirror reflecting a mirror...
Leper,,node_exit_store,All the birds call out in the spring. They are silent in the fall.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_store,"Daft one 'e was, eh?"
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_store,Glad to be rid of that nutter.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_store,Count your coin around that one.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_store,"Steep prices, but you gotta pay em."
Highwayman,,node_exit_store & valley,Ready as we'll ever be.
Highwayman,,node_exit_store & valley,"Road looks clear, torch is high. Let's go."
Grave Robber,,node_exit_store & valley,*shiver* Let us not tarry...
Grave Robber,,node_exit_store & valley,At least we shan't die in the wagonyard.
Occultist,,node_exit_store & valley,I have caravanned greater distance with less.
Occultist,,node_exit_store & valley,Let us not deprive ourselves at journey's dawn.
Hellion,,node_exit_store & valley,"Sooner we're moving, the better."
Hellion,,node_exit_store & valley,A well-stocked larder!
Jester,,node_exit_store & valley,A full flask and a foolish quest!
Jester,,node_exit_store & valley,The epics I'll write if we survive this...
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_store & valley,"Fresh tinctures and powders to sample, ooh!"
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_store & valley,Time to put my latest methods to the test.
Runaway,,node_exit_store & valley,We're stocked up. Never seen so much food.
Runaway,,node_exit_store & valley,Eyes out for bandits. We're a tasty target.
Leper,,node_exit_store & valley,A humble valediction...
Leper,,node_exit_store & valley,We are ready - purpose is now ours to find.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_store & valley,One last chance to steel the ol' nerves.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_store & valley,"A well-provisioned unit, we are!"
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_store & valley,Bet the bandits love this stretch of road.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_store & valley,I travel light.
Highwayman,,node_exit_watchtower,"Better to know how bad it is, I guess."
Highwayman,,node_exit_watchtower,At least we know a little more than we did.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_watchtower,The view would have been lovely... if not for... the state of things.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_watchtower,"It's a bit overwhelming, to see it all... undone..."
Occultist,,node_exit_watchtower,It's worse than I imagined - worse than I dreamed.
Occultist,,node_exit_watchtower,What is clear now is that <i>everything</i> depends on our success.
Hellion,,node_exit_watchtower,"The forests, the fields - gone! Ruined!"
Hellion,,node_exit_watchtower,"We are in hell, aren't we?"
Jester,,node_exit_watchtower,HeheheHAHAHAHA...!
Jester,,node_exit_watchtower,"A beautiful day, wouldn't you agree? Heheh."
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_watchtower,The world is infected - dying!
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_watchtower,Are we all that remains?
Runaway,,node_exit_watchtower,What a long road ahead. Longer behind.
Runaway,,node_exit_watchtower,"Shouldn't have looked. Head down, keep moving."
Leper,,node_exit_watchtower,The sky... it was an ocean once.
Leper,,node_exit_watchtower,We must find some beauty in this devastation.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_watchtower,... it's 'orrible.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_watchtower,"Awful mess all around, innit."
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_watchtower,Least we know what's coming.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_watchtower,Stay the course. Keep moving.
Highwayman,,node_exit_storycosmic,Nothing worth taking.
Highwayman,,node_exit_storycosmic,Academics and their indulgences... feh.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_storycosmic,No trinkets? No baubles? No interest.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_storycosmic,"Well, <i>that</i> was frightfully boring."
Occultist,,node_exit_storycosmic,Fascinating. Could we not go back for a second look?
Occultist,,node_exit_storycosmic,Such an eclectic collection!
Hellion,,node_exit_storycosmic,Rubbish and nonsense!
Hellion,,node_exit_storycosmic,Get us out of here. Find us a foe to face!
Jester,,node_exit_storycosmic,Must've dozed off...
Jester,,node_exit_storycosmic,*yawn*
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_storycosmic,"My conclusion? Interesting, but decadently occult."
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_storycosmic,Superstition has no place in science.
Runaway,,node_exit_storycosmic,Madmen pursing madness - I want none of it.
Runaway,,node_exit_storycosmic,Let's get far away from this place.
Leper,,node_exit_storycosmic,Mankind and mystery... one forever outpacing the other.
Leper,,node_exit_storycosmic,"Try as it might, the sun cannot catch the moon."
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_storycosmic,"What was that all about, then?"
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_storycosmic,I'm hungry.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_storycosmic,Wouldn't touch it if I were you.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_storycosmic,Hrm.
Highwayman,,node_exit_success_storycultist,Hah! That'll buy us a little time.
Highwayman,,node_exit_failure_storycultist,I don't <i>ever</i> want to cut it that close again.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_success_storycultist,"You lot aren't welcome here, savvy?"
Grave Robber,,node_exit_failure_storycultist,... gleaming horrors not of our world...
Occultist,,node_exit_success_storycultist,Begone! Return to whatever void birthed you!
Occultist,,node_exit_failure_storycultist,"How deep, the void between the stars..."
Hellion,,node_exit_success_storycultist,HAH! The rush of a hard-earned kill!
Hellion,,node_exit_failure_storycultist,*chattering teeth*
Jester,,node_exit_success_storycultist,That melody... I've killed to it before...
Jester,,node_exit_failure_storycultist,What's that ringing in my ears?!
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_success_storycultist,"Intriguing specimens, but better off dead!"
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_failure_storycultist,Their physiology... so alien... no! NO!
Runaway,,node_exit_success_storycultist,They burn the same as anyone else.
Runaway,,node_exit_failure_storycultist,I hear them! They're GAINING ON US!!
Leper,,node_exit_success_storycultist,Aberrations. I feel lighter for their absence.
Leper,,node_exit_failure_storycultist,"Carrion creatures, here to feast on our still-dying world."
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_success_storycultist,Drive the bastards back to their hole!
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_failure_storycultist,I will not stand and fight! I cannot! RETREAT!
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_success_storycultist,Send those freaks packing.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_failure_storycultist,Hear that wailing? They hunt us still.
Highwayman,,node_exit_success_dungeon & forest,Old bones ought to stay down.
Highwayman,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & forest,Eyes feel heavy... gotta... stay on my feet...
Highwayman,,node_exit_success_dungeon & farm,And <i>stay</i> down.
Highwayman,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & farm,... what's the worst you've ever eaten to survive...?
Highwayman,,node_exit_success_dungeon & city,"Strange way to feed our flame, but I'll take it."
Highwayman,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & city,So certain we were - and so wrong...
Highwayman,,node_exit_success_dungeon & coast,Good riddance.
Highwayman,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & coast,Damn the horses - run!
Grave Robber,,node_exit_success_dungeon & forest,What's dead should stay buried. Trust me.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & forest,Is this what awaits me at the end? Dreaming forever?
Grave Robber,,node_exit_success_dungeon & farm,Vile things! Another stain scrubbed clean.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & farm,*strangled retching* Avert your eyes! Don't watch me...
Grave Robber,,node_exit_success_dungeon & city,"A marvelous collection - sullied, now... *sigh*"
Grave Robber,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & city,The city is beyond saving. So too are we.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_success_dungeon & coast,The fiend is felled - now for the booty.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & coast,I hear weeping in the mist...
Occultist,,node_exit_success_dungeon & forest,Perhaps I will sleep unbothered tonight...
Occultist,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & forest,What haunts await us next we close our eyes...?
Occultist,,node_exit_success_dungeon & farm,Life may return to these fields in time.
Occultist,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & farm,We are all but flesh in the jaws of something greater.
Occultist,,node_exit_success_dungeon & city,So many precious volumes lost... yet we remain.
Occultist,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & city,"The minds of ""great"" men - all rotten! All depraved!"
Occultist,,node_exit_success_dungeon & coast,"Back to your trench, foul leviathan!"
Occultist,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & coast,"Strange tides, a stench that clogs the nose..."
Hellion,,node_exit_success_dungeon & forest,Listen. The birds are finally stirring again.
Hellion,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & forest,Rot! Bile! Scavengers closing in...!
Hellion,,node_exit_success_dungeon & farm,*spits* Spirits curse this forsaken place. Let's go.
Hellion,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & farm,Flee! And salt the earth behind us!
Hellion,,node_exit_success_dungeon & city,Weak city bodies AND hearts! FALL ON MY BLADE!
Hellion,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & city,Fools for trying. Cowards for running. RRRGH...!
Hellion,,node_exit_success_dungeon & coast,"The dry land belongs to us, fiend!"
Hellion,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & coast,Bells toll for us in the fog! RUN!
Jester,,node_exit_success_dungeon & forest,How very like soldiers - dying in rank.
Jester,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & forest,That drumming... it's IN my HEAD...!
Jester,,node_exit_success_dungeon & farm,"You won't be dining on us tonight, fiends!"
Jester,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & farm,*sniff* Skin blackening over meat...
Jester,,node_exit_success_dungeon & city,Talk about a pyrrhic victory. Heheh.
Jester,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & city,"*slow, discordant humming*"
Jester,,node_exit_success_dungeon & coast,Bon voyage!
Jester,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & coast,I prefer to die where they can find my corpse!
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_success_dungeon & forest,What a strange new process of decay that was!
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & forest,They defy science. They should not BE!
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_success_dungeon & farm,I wonder what mother could birth such a curiosity.
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & farm,How long can a stomach go empty? I'll investigate.
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_success_dungeon & city,I wonder at the formula for their accelerants...
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & city,Man's great scholarly works in ashes! Fools! FOOLS!
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_success_dungeon & coast,Did you spy its ocular membranes? Curious...
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & coast,"Overpowering, mouldering corruption!"
Runaway,,node_exit_success_dungeon & forest,Let's raze these weeds and get back on the road.
Runaway,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & forest,Burn it all down behind us. That mumbling...
Runaway,,node_exit_success_dungeon & farm,"Torch the fields just to be sure, I say."
Runaway,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & farm,I'd sooner starve than ever smell meat again.
Runaway,,node_exit_success_dungeon & city,"Oh, you want to burn, do you?! Then BURN!"
Runaway,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & city,N-no... let me go back... it's so warm in there...
Runaway,,node_exit_success_dungeon & coast,"Whatever that thing was, it's dead now."
Runaway,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & coast,This damp is settling in my bones...
Leper,,node_exit_success_dungeon & forest,A tall tree falls in the forest - all is quiet.
Leper,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & forest,Doomed warriors never granted the peace of the grave...
Leper,,node_exit_success_dungeon & farm,A cruel contrivance of starvation and excess.
Leper,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & farm,Let these fields lie fallow forever. We have lost them.
Leper,,node_exit_success_dungeon & city,"A city under siege - but stirring within its walls, hope."
Leper,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & city,Let the flames feast on the corpse of man's hubris.
Leper,,node_exit_success_dungeon & coast,The stone defies the eroding waves.
Leper,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & coast,Halt. Let us accept our end with composure.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_success_dungeon & forest,This foul mimicry of a campaign must end.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & forest,"Their faces...! Brothers, have you come for me at last?"
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_success_dungeon & farm,Perhaps the people can rebuild. I hope so.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & farm,Ghkk! Bile in my throat... the smell...!
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_success_dungeon & city,There are folk in this town not yet lost to madness.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & city,This city is sick. Perhaps it <i>should</i> fall to ashes...
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_success_dungeon & coast,We made chum of the bastards!
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & coast,"Retreat! If you want my blood, it won't come gifted!"
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_success_dungeon & forest,An old contract collected...
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & forest,They saw us coming.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_success_dungeon & farm,Another trophy for the mantle.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & farm,Amateurs! I could have had them!
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_success_dungeon & city,Not the first madman I've put down.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & city,Follow my lead next time.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_success_dungeon & coast,The bigger they are...
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_failure_dungeon & coast,Not worth it. Back to dry land!
Highwayman,,node_exit_success_guardian,In and out - a perfect job!
Highwayman,,node_exit_failure_guardian,Let's get the hell out of here!
Grave Robber,,node_exit_success_guardian,"A beastly thing, but we performed perfectly!"
Grave Robber,,node_exit_failure_guardian,I-it's too much! That was too much!
Occultist,,node_exit_success_guardian,Another abomination falls!
Occultist,,node_exit_failure_guardian,I-I had no idea...
Hellion,,node_exit_success_guardian,AKYLORAAAHHH!
Hellion,,node_exit_failure_guardian,N-no! No more!
Jester,,node_exit_success_guardian,Ha HA! Time for a song!
Jester,,node_exit_failure_guardian,"Joke's on us then, eh?"
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_success_guardian,Precision! Poise! A successful operation!
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_failure_guardian,H-how could it... I don't...
Runaway,,node_exit_success_guardian,"Whew, we did it...!"
Runaway,,node_exit_failure_guardian,RUN!
Leper,,node_exit_success_guardian,A sunrise at last.
Leper,,node_exit_failure_guardian,Pity the starless sky.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_success_guardian,We've done it <i>together!</i> A fighting family!
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_failure_guardian,RETREAT! It's a rout...!
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_success_guardian,Could take a dozen of 'em.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_failure_guardian,They'll follow. Get a move on.
Highwayman,,node_exit_cache,Nice.
Highwayman,,node_exit_cache,"It's something, at least."
Grave Robber,,node_exit_cache,"A lovely little turn of events, I'd say."
Grave Robber,,node_exit_cache,"Complimentary, no less!"
Occultist,,node_exit_cache,Excellent.
Occultist,,node_exit_cache,A most fortunate find.
Hellion,,node_exit_cache,Ha HAH! Good for us!
Hellion,,node_exit_cache,"Off we go, then!"
Jester,,node_exit_cache,Will any of this stuff even matter?
Jester,,node_exit_cache,Where are we going to put all this?
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_cache,Supplies are always welcome.
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_cache,Well stocked and ready for triage!
Runaway,,node_exit_cache,Take all we can carry. Quick.
Runaway,,node_exit_cache,Nice find!
Leper,,node_exit_cache,Some fortunate thread in fate's tangled skein.
Leper,,node_exit_cache,"Fortune is fickle, but today she smiles."
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_cache,"Tooth and tail, as they say."
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_cache,Every army needs a supply line.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_cache,Let's not weigh ourselves down.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_cache,None for me. I like to stay a little hungry.
Highwayman,,node_exit_bridge,What's that chill?
Highwayman,,node_exit_bridge,No turning back now.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_bridge,Hold fast to your memories of sunny days - they are no more.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_bridge,*sigh* So be it.
Occultist,,node_exit_bridge,We are beyond the wards now... vulnerable.
Occultist,,node_exit_bridge,We have trained for this - but are we ready?
Hellion,,node_exit_bridge,Let us leave the past behind!
Hellion,,node_exit_bridge,Is this where we find glory...?
Jester,,node_exit_bridge,"Hello darkness, my old friend."
Jester,,node_exit_bridge,Suppose I've got nothing else on.
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_bridge,The great experiment begins...
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_bridge,Time to put my learnings to practice.
Runaway,,node_exit_bridge,We're on our own now.
Runaway,,node_exit_bridge,Better in here than out there.
Leper,,node_exit_bridge,Four roads converge into one path. Our path.
Leper,,node_exit_bridge,Wheels spin as the earth does - eternal.
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_bridge,"Farewell, sweet safety."
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_bridge,Behind enemy lines...
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_bridge,The hunt is on.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_bridge,I'll make this worth your coin.
Highwayman,,node_exit_oasis,That weren't so bad. On with it.
Highwayman,,node_exit_oasis,"Back to the unrelenting horrors, eh."
Grave Robber,,node_exit_oasis,"No rest for the wicked, loves."
Grave Robber,,node_exit_oasis,Let us hope my hair dries in a timely fashion...
Occultist,,node_exit_oasis,Clean fingernails and rested mind - a rarity.
Occultist,,node_exit_oasis,An oasis on the road is a rare blessing.

Jester,,node_exit_oasis,Eugh. My stockings got wet...
Jester,,node_exit_oasis,I dare say that was almost pleasant.
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_oasis,"Refreshed, revitalized, ready."
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_oasis,Have my robes <i>always<i> smelt of Javel water?
Runaway,,node_exit_oasis,Hope that stop didn't cost us...
Runaway,,node_exit_oasis,"C'mon, let's get moving."
Leper,,node_exit_oasis,Golden sun on clear water - a good omen.
Leper,,node_exit_oasis,"Silvery moon on dark water - a sign, perhaps."
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_oasis,"Back at it, you lot."
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_oasis,*gentle snoring*
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_oasis,*gulp* Ahhh.
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_oasis,We'll look the fool if we're ambushed...
Highwayman,,node_exit_success_creatureden,One less hazard on the road.
Highwayman,,node_exit_failure_creatureden,They may pursue us - staunch that bleeding.
Grave Robber,,node_exit_success_creatureden,"Ahh, the coach smells lovely by comparison."
Grave Robber,,node_exit_failure_creatureden,Horrid things. Make haste from here!
Occultist,,node_exit_success_creatureden,Minor horrors in the scheme of things.
Occultist,,node_exit_failure_creatureden,Those creatures were...unnatural.
Hellion,,node_exit_success_creatureden,Wouldn't chance the meat. Pity.
Hellion,,node_exit_failure_creatureden,Madness! Run!
Jester,,node_exit_success_creatureden,Heheh. Good riddance.
Jester,,node_exit_failure_creatureden,My bloodstains have bloodstains.
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_success_creatureden,"See here, I was able to sample some ichors..."
Plague Doctor,,node_exit_failure_creatureden,No classroom dissection could prepare me for this!

Man-at-arms,,node_exit_success_creatureden,"Human smarts still win the day, eh?"
Man-at-arms,,node_exit_failure_creatureden,Bah! We were unprepared - overconfident!
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_success_creatureden,"Easy prey, easy pay."
Bounty Hunter,,node_exit_failure_creatureden,Outwitted by beasts? Feh.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_HWY_01,I <i>earned</i> that second chance.
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_HWY_01,"What's a few broken knuckles, eh?"
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_HWY_02,Justice is seldom seen on the road.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_HWY_03,A meal wasn't all I was starved for.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_HWY_04,Loved the thrill... and hated that I still loved it.
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_HWY_04,Ought to have known better.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_HWY_05,Did he set me up? Does it even matter?
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_HWY_06,So much for second chances.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_GR_01,I masked my venom - as a young Lady must.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_GR_02,That gasp as he expired was the only time he ever pleasured me.
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_GR_02,He would rue the gods-damned day...!
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_GR_03,"Even more worthless than I thought him, the wretch."
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_GR_04,The things a woman learns about herself.
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_GR_04,I would not let myself die destitute.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_GR_05,I was guilty only of impulsivity... truly...
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_GR_06,Right and wrong matter naught. Hell is here regardless.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_OCC_01,"It was... lonely, in the void."
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_OCC_02,Something in those silent halls sang out to only me.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_OCC_03,Why mourn things that only held me back?
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_OCC_03,True seekers shed such limitations.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_OCC_04,All knowledge comes at a price.
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_OCC_04,They were fools to trust me.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_OCC_05,Well... my mind is certainly no longer lonely.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_OCC_06,The stars roil and seethe. I never truly sleep.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_HEL_01,Glory was mine for the taking.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_HEL_02,True battle was nothing like the training pits.
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_HEL_02,The naysayers in camp... they knew...!
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_HEL_03,"My brothers, my sisters, calling for me as they died..."
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_HEL_04,A coward's death was too good for me!
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_HEL_04,"When an ox can no longer pull, we put it down."
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_HEL_05,Let my coward's blood soak the dirt.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_HEL_06,"If I slay my way to glory, what kin await me...?"
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_JES_01,"It calls to me, even as a memory..."
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_JES_02,Ever wanted something so bad your bones ache?
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_JES_02,"Desire and despair, merry bedfellows."
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_JES_03,"Hmph. You'd have snapped, too."
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_JES_04,Could have played 'til that whole <i>city</i> stood empty.
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_JES_04,Power - sweeter than the high from any pipe.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_JES_05,That massacre was my magnum opus.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_JES_06,Suppose I'll have to die the old-fashioned way.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_PD_01,"Fools! Conventional, tedious fools!"
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_PD_02,Those philistines <i>earned</i> my ire.
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_PD_02,Their whispers mock me even now...
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_PD_03,A fitting fate. I regret nothing!
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_PD_04,It was genius! ... genius...
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_PD_04,Was this triumph? Or another failed experiment?
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_PD_05,What horror I have wrought.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_PD_06,"How many must I put down before, at last, silence?"
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_RUN_01,So much for their oath of charity.
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_RUN_01,"They marked me like a mule, so I kicked."
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_RUN_02,I barely knew what to do with kindness.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_RUN_03,Everyone remembers their first love...
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_RUN_04,Rapture and pain - one and the same.
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_RUN_04,Why didn't I even <i>try</i> to warn them...?
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_RUN_05,My scars ache...
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_RUN_06,Fire can't be tamed.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_LEP_01,Compassion is its own strength.
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_LEP_02,You all might learn some lessons in mercy.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_LEP_02,I mourned my body and the kingdom I might have forged.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_LEP_03,"The sun rises and sets, unwavering."
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_LEP_04,A diagnosis - and a remedy - freeing in its finality.
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_LEP_04,The palace's very foundations trembled...
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_LEP_05,The time for mourning is past.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_LEP_06,A worthy heart beats in this world yet.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_MAA_01,Don't say you squits never dreamed of victory.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_MAA_02,Deserted by my own cunning...
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_MAA_02,Why couldn't they bloody listen?!
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_MAA_03,I was but a child playing commander.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_MAA_04,"A cursed old fool, bogged down by despair."
,,node_exit_failure_storyhero & herostory_MAA_04,Was I even worthy of sending them off?
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_MAA_05,I repay them wound by wound.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_MAA_06,"Til my final skirmish, my shield is your shield."
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_BH_01,Not worth thinking about.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_BH_02,We've all done things...
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_BH_03,"Nothing behind, nothing ahead."
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_BH_04,Don't ask.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_BH_05,Leave it.
,,node_exit_success_storyhero & herostory_BH_06,My burdens are my own.
,,traveling_stress_heal,Perhaps there is hope for us yet...
,,traveling_stress_heal,We are not so dissimilar...
,,traveling_stress_heal,I accept you. We all do.
,,traveling_stress_heal,"Chin up, shoulders back. We can do this."
,,traveling_stress_heal,The road is tough but we're going to make it.
,,traveling_stress_heal,Let us share tales of merrier times.
,,traveling_stress_heal,"Come what may, we are united!"
,,traveling_stress_heal,Hang in there.
,,traveling_stress_heal,Can I get you anything?
,,traveling_stress_heal,"It's a long road, but we've got each other."
,,traveling_stress_heal,Want to share? I've got extra...
,,traveling_stress_heal,You're even tougher than you look.
,,traveling_stress_heal,"I'm glad you're here, for what it's worth."
,,traveling_stress_heal,You're going to live. I won't hear otherwise.
,,traveling_stress_heal,At least we aren't facing this alone.
,,traveling_stress_heal,Maybe all hope is not lost...
,,traveling_stress_heal,There are times I almost feel hopeful.
,,traveling_stress_heal,"I had a pleasant dream, for once..."
,,traveling_stress_heal,"Whatever comes, we are united."
,,traveling_stress_heal,Perhaps we'll find glory after all...
,,traveling_stress_heal,This world is worth saving.
,,traveling_stress_heal,We are making a difference out there.
,,traveling_stress_heal,"Hope is seductive, isn't it?"
,,traveling_stress_heal,We're making good time.
,,traveling_stress_heal,"If this is my fate, I'm content."
,,traveling_stress_heal,All is not lost.
,,traveling_stress_heal,We will best these fiends!
Bounty Hunter,,traveling_stress_heal,Fine. I'll share a drink.
Bounty Hunter,,traveling_stress_heal,You lot seem capable.
Bounty Hunter,,traveling_stress_heal,Who's up for dice?
,,traveling_stress_damage,Buffoon!
,,traveling_stress_damage,"We're not going to make it, are we?"
,,traveling_stress_damage,"Everywhere, the world comes undone..."
,,traveling_stress_damage,Stuck in a coach with the likes you - feh.
,,traveling_stress_damage,I'm hungry and tired!
,,traveling_stress_damage,This cursed coach is a bouncing racket!
,,traveling_stress_damage,Let me out of this blasted coach!
,,traveling_stress_damage,"Here we are, four corpses in a rolling coffin..."
,,traveling_stress_damage,I can't bear to look out the window...
,,traveling_stress_damage,It's like a nightmare out there.
,,traveling_stress_damage,Like rats in a trap...
,,traveling_stress_damage,What if it's all for nothing...?
,,traveling_stress_damage,Can I really trust you to have my back...?
,,traveling_stress_damage,Can't sleep. Awful food. Worse company.
,,traveling_stress_damage,A waking nightmare...
,,traveling_stress_damage,We never seem to make any progress...
,,traveling_stress_damage,Just leave me by the roadside.
,,traveling_stress_damage,This was all a mistake...!
,,traveling_stress_damage,We're driving in circles...
,,traveling_stress_damage,Are we lost?
,,traveling_stress_damage,This is not the life I dreamt for myself...
,,traveling_stress_damage,"Everywhere we pass - ruin, destruction..."
,,traveling_stress_damage,"Fools, fools we are..."
,,traveling_stress_damage,We were damned before we set off.
,,traveling_stress_damage,Why us? Why me?
,,traveling_stress_damage,I'm not crying...! Look away!
,,traveling_stress_damage,I grow so weary of this fight.
,,traveling_stress_damage,Would it be so bad to give in...?
Bounty Hunter,,traveling_stress_damage,...
Bounty Hunter,,traveling_stress_damage,Leave me be. I'm napping.
Bounty Hunter,,traveling_stress_damage,Don't test me.
